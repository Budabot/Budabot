Note: Budabot is no longer supported, although it should continue to work for the forseeable future.  If you need a new bot, especially a bot that will work on RK6 (RK2019) then I recommend using Tyrbot (https://github.com/Budabot/Tyrbot), which is a new bot I have written.  Feel free to join the discord channel if you need help with this new bot: https://discord.gg/2x9WesJ

### Cloning The Repository ###
Alternatively you can clone the Budabot git repository. The advantage to doing this is that as new changes are committed you can simply do `git pull` to pull those changes into your copy.

## Running Budabot

To start the bot, run the ```chatbot.bat``` file (on linux run the ```chatbot.sh``` file). If it is your first time running the bot, it will take you through the configuration wizard to configure the bot. You will need to have a character name that you you want to run the bot as along with the username and password for the account that has that character. If you want to run this bot as an org bot, you will also need the EXACT org name of the org and the character that the bot runs as will need to have already been invited to the org.
