<header> :::::: Org Bank: Banksearch Help :::::: <end>

If you know the name of an Org member who has a bank you can easily go directly to it by typing:

<highlight>/tell <myname> banksearch < name of player ><end>

You could also type !banksearch < name of player > in the Org chatline. 

The Budabot shortcut for this command is: <highlight>!bs <name of player><end>
