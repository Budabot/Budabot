<header> :::::: Org Bank: Delete Item Help :::::: <end>

Sometimes items just don't want to Delete. This is because Funcom does not follow it's own rules on naming items. The normal way to delete items is to use the <grey>DELETE<end> button next to the item in your Bank. If that doesn't work try this:

<highlight> /tell <myname> shopdel <ql of item> <partial name of the item><end>

Example: <highlight> bankdel 10 cushion<end>

If no items match, the delete is cancelled. If more than 1 item matches, you will be asked to clarify your deletion.

The Budabot alias for this command is: <highlight>!bd <ql> <partial name of item><end>
