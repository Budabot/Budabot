To find items that buff an ability or skill:
<highlight><tab><symbol>whatbuffs<end>

To find items that buff an ability or skill using auno.org data:
<highlight><tab><symbol>whatbuffs1<end>

To find items that buff an ability or skill using aoitems.com data:
<highlight><tab><symbol>whatbuffs2<end>

By default, <highlight><symbol>whatbuffs<end> is aliased to <highlight><symbol>whatbuffs2<end> so it returns aoitems.com data.  If you have a preference on which data is better, please make a post at <a href='chatcmd:///start http://budabot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1379'>http://budabot.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1379</a>. Specific examples would be extremely helpful but any feedback is welcome.

If you would prefer to use auno.org data, you can change the alias to do so by first removing the old alias:

<highlight><symbol>alias rem whatbuffs<end>

And then adding the new one:

<highlight><symbol>alias add whatbuffs whatbuffs1<end>
