<header>::::: Privategroup News :::::<end>

This is supposed for Raidbots where the admin wants to set News like Botupdates etc. They are splitted into 2 different types. The first one will be shown to all non-admin and the second one will be shown only for admins of the Bot. Both will be only shown when he joins the privategroup and they contains text(means when you clear them they will not be shown).
