This module is designed to help you calculate where to put your research bar so that you get the maximum amount of the mission reward going into your xp bar, while letting the rest spill over into research.

Experience(XP/SK)

To show needed research % to cap xp
<highlight><tab><symbol>capxp 'mission reward amount' 'your level'<end>

You can also use <highlight>!capsk<end> ...the two are interchangeable

If you are level 200 or above, specify the reward amount in sk. If you are under level 200, specify the reward amount in xp.  Ie. just copy paste the reward amount from your mission info-window.
