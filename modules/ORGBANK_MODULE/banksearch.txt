<green><left>If you know the name of an Org member who has a bank you can easily go directly to it by typing:

<yellow>/tell <myname> banksearch < name of player > <end>

You could also type !banksearch < name of player > in the Org chatline. 

The Budabot shortcut for this command is: <yellow>!bs <name of player>
