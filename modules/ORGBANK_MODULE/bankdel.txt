<yellow><center>::::: Org Bank: Delete Item Help :::::</center><end>

<green><left>Sometimes items just don't want to Delete. This is because Funcom does not follow it's own rules on naming items. The normal way to delete items is to use the <grey> DELETE <green>button next to the item in your Bank. If that doesn't work try this:

 <yellow> /tell <myname> shopdel <ql of item> <partial name of the item>

<green>Example:<end><yellow> bankdel 10 cushion 

<green>If no items match, the delete is cancelled. If more than 1 item matches, you will be asked to clarify your deletion.

<green>The Budabot alias for this command is: <yellow>!bd <ql> <partial name of item><end>
