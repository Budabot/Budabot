<yellow><center>::::::  Org Bank: Help ::::::</center><end>

<green><left>Welcome to <yellow><myname>'s <green>Org Bank<end>.

<green>To start off, you need to create a Bank. You can do that by sending a tell to the bot.

<yellow> /tell <myname> bank<end>

Or on the guild chatline, typing <yellow>!bank<end>

<green><left>This will take you to an info page that helps you create and manage your bank and also gives you <grey>'buttons'<green>.

<green><left>With these you can list other players who are in the bank, and search for items available to you. You can also add or delete items in your own Bank and read some help files.  

<green><left>Of course, once you are happy using <grey>Org Bank<green>, you may not want to use the menu's and buttons, so these can be hidden away until required. 

A complete list of the <grey>Org Bank<green> commands can be found using:

<yellow>/tell <myname> help bankcommands<green>.

<yellow><left>Note: <green>Almost all commands have aliase's. It is much quicker to use them. It also means much less spam on your org line. Better yet, use tells. I'm sure your org will appreciate that. :)



<green><left>I really hope you and your Org. find <grey>Org Bank<green> useful.

<yellow>Have fun! o/<end>
