Example:
<symbol>wtb combined

Example:
<symbol>wtb 75 combined

will return the 20 most recent items posted to shopping that contain "combined" in the name and are ql 75 that have been posted to the shopping channel in the last 10 days.

Example:
<symbol>wtb 70 75 combined

will return the 20 most recent items posted to shopping that contain "combined" in the name and are at least ql 70 and at most ql 75 that have been posted to the shopping channel in the last 10 days.

Note that "!wtb comb officer" will not return any results since the wildcards are added to the end of the string only and not at word boundaries (eg "%comb officer%"). This is specific to how aojunkyard.com handles searches, not the module. This also means that while "!wtb combined officer" will return results, "!wtb officer combined" will not.
