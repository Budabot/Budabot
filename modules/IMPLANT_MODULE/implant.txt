To shows stats for implants at given QL:
<highlight><tab><symbol>implant 'QL'<end>

To shows highest QL implant for a given ability and treatment:
<highlight><tab><symbol>implant 'ability' 'treatment'<end>

For instance, if you had 404 agility and 951 treatment, you would do
<highlight><tab><symbol>implant 404 951<end>
And the bot would tell you the highest ql implant you could wear.

Note that this command works for normal and refined implants from ql 1 up to ql 300, but not implants with Jobe clusters in them.

When you view more info on an implant ql, the range of numbers next to the modifier tells you the range of quality levels that will give you the same modifier.

For instance,

<tab>Faded   22 (196 - 208)

means that you will get 22 points (of ability, in this case) from the faded cluster slot starting with ql 196 on up to ql 208.
