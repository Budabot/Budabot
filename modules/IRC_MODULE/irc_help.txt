To start the IRC relay, a moderator or higher needs to do <highlight>/tell <myname> <symbol>startirc<end>, or you can set it to auto-connect on bot-startup in the <symbol>settings.

...but before you do, please read these important setup instructions:

In the bots <symbol>settings, you will find the details that lets you control how and when you connect to IRC.  If the IRC-status reads 0 you are not currently connected to IRC.  When it reads 1, it means a connection was successful.

There are various settings you need to set in order to connect to IRC (All of them have been set by default, but you may customize them).  They are: the server address, the server port, the nickname the bot will use, and the irc channel it should connect to.

By default, your bot will use these settings:

<tab>Server = irc.funcom.com
<tab>Port = 6667
<tab>Nickname = <myname>
<tab>Channel = #GuildName
<tab>Password = <i>none</i>

If the bot is not in a guild, it will join #<myname>
To manually set on of these settings <highlight>/tell <myname> <symbol>setirc [irc-setting] [data]<end>
ie. <symbol>setirc nickname my-bots-irc-name
<symbol>setirc port 6667

Note: to disable the password set it to 'none'.

<highlight>/tell Legendadv<end> (RK2) if you have any questions/comments/concerns/suggestions.
Thanks and enjoy.
