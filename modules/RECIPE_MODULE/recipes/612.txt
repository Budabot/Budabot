#C12 *** #C16 Before you go on, this armor is one of rarest found on Rubi-Ka. So far only handfull of pieces were found, even if it made ingame years ago (only confirmed drop is reported from lvl 59 Nano Breed mob inside mission). And since it's limited buffs, mostly collectors would be interested in it. #C12 *** #C20

#C16 The Nano Programming Interface can be bought from tools terminals. Inactive OT Metamorphing Liquid Nanobots are in armor and clothing components terminals. Hacker Tool drop from missions and can also be purchased at regular shops. 

First, you need to prepare OT Metamorphing Liquid Nanobots. If you want fully augmented armor, you'll need 10 pieces of them for each armor piece you're making. Nano Programming Interface doesn't get used up in the process.#C20

#C16Notes: Inactive OT Nanobots must be within 90% of armor. #C20

#C16 Once this is sorted, you're ready to start on armor itself.#C20

#C16 You can repeat this process 9 more times each time after the 2nd upgrade the NP increases by 60 points to a final skill of 540 NP on final upgrade.#C20

#C16 If you manage to collect all 5 pieces of armor (4 different pieces and extra sleeve, since there aren't that many one-armed characters around) and upgrade them to maximum, you'll get bonus of:

MaxNanoEnergy: 1100
NanoC.Init: 250

With that, only practical use for it, that I can think of, is maybe some NT or Doctor twink, but they would still be penalized for lack of AC or Nano Skill mods on this armor.#C20
