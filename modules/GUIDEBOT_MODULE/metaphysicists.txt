Section 1: Creating your MP
As with starting any character in the game of Anarchy Online, your journey will begin with creating a character. This section will give you the information and advice you'll need to create the right kind of MP for you. This guide is focussed on the MP specific elements of beginning a character in Anarchy Online and will lead you through most of the process of getting started. For more general information about the game though you should refer to:

The official “New Arrivals” Forum
 
* * * Newbie-Style FAQ Guide * * *


The first thing you need to do to get started with your MP is to create your character:

Login to the game with your user name and password
Under "Character Name" use the drop down box to select [Create new character]
Click on the "Play" Button
You will then arrive at the space station and choose your basic character in the laboratories there
Your first selection will be for Breed and Gender

Choosing a Breed and Gender for your Metaphysicist

Your gender has no effect on the actual characteristics of your MP. You can freely choose whichever gender you want to be. 

But your choice of Breed has a definite effect on the play of your MP and you'll need to choose carefully. The question of the 'best breed for the MP' is a source of much discussion on the MP forums. Every player has their own idea of which breed is best and this will depend on a whole series of different factors. Without knowing and understanding the details of the MP you may struggle to make a good choice. 

What does Breed affect?

Your breed affects your basic Abilities:

Strength
Agillity
Stamina
Intelligence
Sense
Psychic

The basic abilities have two main roles.

The equipping of Armour: 

Armour is worn in AO to reduce the amount of damage done to you by others. Many types of armour also include "buffs" which are increases for your skills which you get when you wear the armour. There are many different types of armour in the game. Nearly all armour has at least one requirement based on a basic ability and most armour is based on two basic abilities. Different types of armour require different abilities to equip them. To equip the armour you need that level of the ability or abilities.

Trickledown Skills Increases: 

Almost everything in the game of AO, is based around your skills. In order to equip items, use items, cast nano-formulae (AO's version of spells) and so on - you need to have reached the required skill level. You raise the skills by investing points (IP) which you earn by gaining levels. All skills are based on one or more Abilities. You can also gain a small number of Skill points by raising the abilities on which the Skill is based.


Your breed also affects:

Nanopool size: 

This is similar to Mana in other games. Nanopool is the energy used up when casting Nano formulae, which are AO's version of spells.

Hitpoints: 

This is your health. As you get damaged you lose health. When you get to zero health you die.


Finally, your breed affects your maximum Nanocost Reduction statistic. Each nano (spell) that you cast in AO has a certain nanocost associated with it. Each time you cast a nano this cost is taken out of your Nanopool. It is possible to reduce the cost of each nano cast with certain buffing nanos and also with certain items. The NanoCost Reduction stat defines how much reduction you get on the cost of each nano. It is stated as a percent figure. For each breed, there is a maximum allowed NanoCost Reduction beyond which you cannot go. These are called the nanocost reduction Breed Caps.

Nanocost Reduction Breed Caps:

·        Nanomage: 55% reduction

·        Solitus:                   50% reduction

·        Opifex:                   50% reduction

·        Atrox:                     45% reduction


How does Breed affect your basic Abilities?

Each of your abilities is given one of three colours:

Green
Abilities that are green cost fewer IP Points to raise for each point. They will also reach their maximum at the highest possible level.
Light Blue
Abilities that are light blue cost more IP points for each point than a green skill. They reach a maximum that is lower than for green skills.
Dark Blue
These are the most expensive abilities to raise. They also have the lowest maximum.



The breed you choose will affect the colour of your abilities. The green abilities reach their absolute maxes at a higher point than light blue – which in turn reach their absolute maxes at a higher point than dark blue. At the highest levels, this limitation can be very important indeed.

Here are the colour allocations for each of the four breeds. The begin value given is the amount of the ability you will start off with. The 200 Max value, is the maximum value you can have for the ability at level 200. You will be able to raise the abilities approximately twice as high as the 200 max by the time you reach level 220 – but we’re not sure yet just what the very top maximum values will be.


Solitus:

The solitus breed has all 6 basic abilities as light blue. This makes the Solitus an all rounder. They have no cheap abilities (green) but they also have no expensive abilities (dark blue). All 6 abilities will reach the same maximum values. The Solitus MP begins with 6 points in each skill.

The Atrox breed is very strong in Strength and Stamina. This breed has 3 Dark Blue abilities which means that the general cost of abilities is much higher than for other breeds.










How does breed affect your Nanopool and Hitpoints?

Your nanopool and your hitpoint amounts are based on two skills. These skills are raised just like ordinary skills, by spending IP points earned at each new level. They are also affected by trickledown from your abilities. The actual amount of nanopool and hitpoints is determined by your breed. Each breed multiplies your skill by a certain amount.

Nanopool:

The Nanopool skill is based mostly on Psychic (70%). It is also based on Intelligence (10%), Sense (10%) and Stamina (10%). Breeds with excellent Psychic will have slightly higher nanopool skill than breeds with low Psychic. The MP has a green Nanopool skill, which means it can be maxed at a higher level than most other skills and costs relatively little in IP per point. Additionally, you get a certain number of nanopoints added on to this total each time you level. 

The actual amount of nanopool is defined as follows:

Breed
Skill Multiplier
Points per Level
Begin Value
Nanomage
5
5
48

Solitus
4
4
32

Opifex
4
3
31

Atrox
3
4
20


This means that with all abilities at their maximum values for their breeds the Nanomage has a considerable lead in Nanopool and the Atrox has the smallest Nanopool. Solitus and Opifex have approximately the same nanopool values. 

Hitpoints:

Your hitpoints are based on your Body Development skill. The Body Development skill is based entirely on the Stamina ability (100%). Breeds with excellent Stamina will have slightly better hitpoints than breeds with low stamina. The MP has a dark blue Body Dev. skill, which means it has a low maximum compared to the other skills and costs a lot of IP to raise. Additionally, you get a certain number of  hitpoints added on to this total each time you level.

This means that with all abilities at their maximum values for their breeds, the Atrox has a considerable lead in hitpoints and the Nanomage has the smallest htipoints. Solitus and Opifex have approximately the same hitpoint values. 





So which breed should I choose?

As mentioned above, this is a question that many MPs discuss at great length. All of the breeds can make a good MP. Each of the breeds has their plus sides and down sides for an MP. There are various tricks and items that you can use to balance up the downsides though - so in general each of the breeds will make an excellent MP with careful character development. Still - there's always heated discussion gong on in the MP forums about which breed is the best.

Part of the reason for this heated discussion is that a lot will depend upon how you play your MP. The Meta-Physicist is a profession that allows several, quite different playstyles. As a result depending upon your playstyle, you may want to choose different breeds. Here's a brief summary of the playstyles that each breed suits and why:

General:

The MP is essentially a very strongly casting based profession. Most of the MP tools are cast using nano formulae (Nanos). We also have many nanos that are cast during battle. The nanos are cast using 6 key nanoskills, all of which are 80% dependent upon intelligence - so intelligence can be an important element because it adds to the nanoskills through trickledown.

Because MPs have nanos that can be cast in battle, having a larger nanopool can help to maintain your casting for longer and having a high nanocost reduction statistic can help too. Having said that, MPs use their nanoskills to cast pets, which last for around 30 minutes or longer. The pets are an important part of the MPs toolset and since they don't need recasting very often, the MP doesn't have to focus on casting if he'd prefer to use a weapon.

The MP has the weakest weapons skills in the game on the whole, but is able to hold his own with a weapon if need be. Because of the way that AO's game mechanics work, it isn't possible to both attack with a nano and attack with a weapon at the same time. This means that if you choose to focus on a weapon, you will find that casting a nano will interrupt your attacks and so you'll be less able to cast if you want to get the best out of your weapon.

Because they have a dark blue Body Development skill, MPs generally have very low hitpoints compared to other professions. As a result, the MP isn't designed to be in the front of battle. The general idea is that the MP uses his pets to go into close battle and then uses his nanos to cast from a distance away. For players who prefer to be in the thick of things, it's a good idea to choose a breed that has higher hitpoints. 

Player Vs Player (PvP) battles are a special case. In PvP, having high hitpoints is very important indeed. Also because of the way that PvP works in AO, using a weapon can be very important indeed. An MP playing without using a weapon will find themselves at a considerable disadvantage in PvP. If you plan to take part in PvP of any kind, then you will need to choose a breed with high hitpoints and you will want to focus on using a weapon during battle, so choosing a strong nano-casting breed may not be the best choice.


Nanomage: 

Medium Difficulty Rating: Easy ability choices but more challenging to build well.

For MPs who cast a great deal, having high nanopool and high nanocost reduction can be very important. Nanomages have the best nanopool and nanocost reduction breed cap and so make excellent casters. Also, Nanomages have the best Intelligence in the game and as a result benefit from better trickledown additions to their nano casting skills. Most MP specific armour in the game has Intelligence and Psychic requirements to wear it. Since Nanomages have excellent Int and Psy, they can usually equip the best MP armour more easily.

On the downside though, nanomages have weak hitpoints and since most weapons skills are based on Strength and Agility the nanomage MP is slightly weaker than MPs of other breeds with weapons. If you're going to play a lot of PvP with your MP, then nanomage is probably the weakest choice of all. Also, although MP specific armours are based on Int/Psy, many other types of armour at some levels and in some ways are better than the special MP armours. Most of the very top armour in the game is based on Strength and Stamina - both of which are not the nanomage's best abilities. In general, you'll find that the nanomage is not able to equip the very best armour in the game as easily as other breeds can.

On the whole then, if you're a player who likes to get into the thick of battle or who likes to PvP, then the nanomage may not be the best choice for you. If you're a player who prefers to focus on controlling pets and casting nanos from range - then the nanomage is probably one of the strongest breeds for the MP. Having said that, it is perfectly possible to make a good PvP nanomage MP and it is perfectly possible to make a strong casting MP from other breeds.

Solitus:

Easy Difficulty Rating: Solitus is the easiest breed to play for the MP. It can also be the least exciting and interesting as a result. 

The solitus is a good all-rounder breed. They have equal abilities and as a result aren't particularly strong or weak in any area. As a result, you can make a good casting MP, a good PvP MP, a good weapons MP or any kind of MP with the Solitus breed. Solitus is a safe choice for a total beginner in AO. 

With Solitus you can usually raise your abilities more easily to equip any armour in the game. Since each ability has the same maximum and the same cost, you can decide for yourself which type of armour you'd like to wear and then raise the ability to do that.

Solitus MPs have a medium hitpoints range, a medium nanopool, a medium nanocost reduction and a medium weapons skills range. They're neither excellent nor bad in anything. 

Opifex:

Hard Difficulty Rating: Opifex MPs can be a challenge to play well. In particular the Abilities section is hard to manage.

The Opifex is an interesting profession for the MP. They tend to have good hitpoints and good nanopool at higher levels and their high agility helps them to keep out of trouble quite well by adding by trickledown to the defensive skills. In terms of the MP tools, the Opifex is certainly a good all-rounder.

On the downside, the Dark Blue Stamina of the opifex means that it can be costly to raise it a lot. Since Stamina is the main contributor to Body Development, this means that although they can reach nearly the same Hitpoints as a Solitus, it will cost them more IP to do so. Also, since the MP is basically a casting profession, it's important to raise Intelligence as high as possible. By the time the Opifex has raised his Stamina for his hitpoints and his intelligence to the max - he has relatively little IP left over to raise both his Agility and Sense. Unfortunately, the armour in the game that is designed for the Opifex needs both Agility and Sense to equip. As a result, the opifex is quite a difficult MP to develop with a balance being struck between higher hitpoints and better armours.

The Opifex is probably best for a player who knows AO very well and knows how to get the best out of his IP and is more aware of all of the different tricks. Certainly, the Opifex can make an excellent MP with careful character development.

Atrox:

Medium Difficulty Rating: Atrox MPs present fairly easy choices in regard to IP distribution but present some difficulties with regard to some MP tools and armours.

The Atrox can be a very strong MP to play at the lower levels. With his strong Stamina and high hitpoints he can get right into the thick of battle with less worry of dying. Atrox MPs also tend to have a slight edge with weapons and in particular Melee weaponry. Much of the most popular armour in the game uses either Stamina or Strength - or both. As a result, the Atrox MP can get into that armour more easily because he has green Str. and Sta.

The downsides for the Atrox are in the casting area. Dark Blue intelligence means that his nanoskills tend to be a little way behind other MPs of the same level. The low Atrox multiplier for Nanopool and the low breed cap on Nanocost Reduction also mean that they only have limited nanopool available to them - so casting a great deal during battle is not really an option. Also, the MP specific armours tend to be based particularly on Intelligence in which the Atrox is the weakest of all the breeds - so using MP specific armour and items can be hard work for the Atrox MP.


Choosing your Profession

Once you have chosen your breed and gender, you will be asked to select your profession. Simply click on Meta-Physicist and click accept - safe in the knowledge that you're choosing the best, most interesting and most dynamic profession of all. :)

Choosing your Appearance

Next you'll be given the opportunity to choose your facial and body appearance. Make this choice carefully, because once you have created your character it's impossible to change your appearance in the game!

In theory, your appearance does not have any effect on the game-play. However, some people maintain that a tall player has very slightly longer range than a shorter player. If this is the case, it is most likely to be a bug and will no doubt be fixed at some point in time. For Player Vs Monster (PvM) play, this makes little difference. However, in PvP that extra tiny bit of range can make much more of a difference. If you want to PvP then it's probably best to play on the safe side and choose a "Tall" build for your MP.

Choosing your Nickname

Your name in AO has 3 parts: First Name "Nickname" Last Name.

Your nickname is the name that will appear over your head and is generally the name that you will be known by in AO. During your character creation, you can either get the AO name engine to suggest a nickname for you or choose one yourself. Allowable names need to be at least 4 characters in length and may not include any spaces. The name engine also filters any names and will not allow you to choose many rude or offensive letter combinations.

Your First and Last name will be left blank at character creation. Once you are in game, you may apply for a name change using the /name command. For details of how to do this, once you are in the game itself, hit enter to open up a text input and then type and enter: /name help 




The Arrival Hall

Once you have chosen your name you'll be shuttled down from the space station to the Arrival Hall on the planet Rubika itself. In the Arrival Hall there are various Non-Player Characters (NPCs) who you can chat with to get information about the game and the storyline.

Once you have chatted with them all, you can move on to choose where you wish to begin your life as an MP. Move to the end of the hall and you'll find four gateways:

Gate Name
Details
 
Omni
This is one of the sides in the Rubika Conflict. Omni Tek is the corporate body that rules on Rubika and is mining the planet for resources. Omni Tek is the source of most mechanical technology on the planet. Omni is strongly linked with the dark side of the force in the Shadowlands: The Unredeemed.

Omni characters start in an Omni City Training Ground on Rubika.
Neutral
This is the neutral side in the Rubika Conflict. Neutrals have some advantages and some disadvantages.

The Neutral gateway leads to a Neutral City Training Ground on Rubika.
Clan
This is the opposite side of the Rubika Conflict to Omni. The clans are groups of miners who broke away from what they saw as Omni Tek oppression and formed groups of freedom fighters. Clan and Omni have similar advantages and disadvantages. Clan is linked to the light side of the force in Shadowlands: the Redeemed.

Clan characters start in a Clan City Training Ground on Rubika.
Jobe
The Neutral city of Jobe is where the NTs and MPs worked together to open up portals into the Meta-World of the Shadowlands. Beginning your character here will make him neutral to start off with, but you will be asked to choose sides at some point. 

The Jobe gateway leads to a Training Ground at Jobe Research which is officially a Neutral zone.


Although it is possible to change your side in both the Rubika and Shadowlands conflicts at a later date it can be quite difficult to do so. As a result, it is wise to make a careful choice from the very beginning. If you are unsure about which side you wish to be on in either conflict then choose Jobe or Neutral to begin with. Make sure you do some research on the forums and choose your side before advancing very far though - as reversing some of your actions (particularly in the Shadowlands) can be a very difficult business indeed.

Once you have chosen your side - walk through the gateway corresponding to your choice.

Camera modes
You enter the Arrival Hall with a first-person view of the world, i.e. looking through your character's eyes. If you prefer a third-person view, there are three different versions available. You can locate the different camera modes on the Action Menu, opened by clicking the "Action" button on the left-hand menu. Click the "Camera" button on the action menu to get access to the four camera modes (or use Ctrl-F8):
·        1st Person: 
Looking through your character's eyes.
·        3rd Person Locked: 
The camera will follow the character as if tied to the character by an invisible line.
·        3rd Person Trailing: 
The camera shows your character from the same angle all the time. Default position is straight behind you.
·        3rd Person Rubber: 
As 3rd Person Trailing above, but the camera moves more softly, taking some time to adjust after you make sharp turns. Default position is straight behind you.
The 3rd person camera's position can be adjusted by using the Num Pad. The even numbers (except 0) move the camera around, and you can zoom with + and -. Pressing 5 will bring the camera to its default position.



Section 2: The Training Ground - First Blood

On walking through the gateway, you will find yourself in the Training Ground. The training grounds differ in look and in the mobs (monsters which you kill for experience points) depending upon which gateway you chose. Also, the equipment that you are given varies slightly depending upon which side you have chosen in the conflict. This guide is focussed on giving you an overview of the MP specific elements of the game and as a result won't include all basic game elements such as how to use the interface. For further information on those basic elements, please refer to:

The Anarchy Online Beginner's Guide 

The official “New Arrivals” Forum

* * * Newbie-Style FAQ Guide * * *


This section will tell you about your equipment, how to use it and the basic tactics of how to play an MP in combat. It will cover some of the MP specific elements of the interface that you need to know in order to play the MP though. The section will take you step by step through what you need to do as a new MP in the Training Ground. It takes as a basic assumption that you are using the new GUI which will appear as a set of 5 buttons on either side of the chat area at the bottom of your screen.

The rest of this guide uses the left mouse click as a targeting action and the right mouse click as a “use” action. In order to ensure that you are set up correctly, hit the F10 key to open the Options view. Click on the “Misc” bar to expand it. Find the “Switch Mouse Functionality” setting and disable it.

Also, please note that when a Number key is referred to, AO only accepts the number keys that go from 1 to 0 and are directly above the letters on your keypad. The number keys to the right of some keyboards, also known as the NumPad, will not work for those keyboard shortcuts. Always use the number keys that are above the letters on your keyboard.




Your Inventory


When you arrive in the Training Ground you'll find yourself in a safe area, protected by Guards and a Guide. When you hit the letter I on your keyboard, you'll bring up your inventory in which you'll find the following basic MP Items:

·        Meta-Physicist: Startup Crystal - Lesser Anger Manifestation
            
This Crystal contains a Nano Formula for your first attack pet.

·        Clan Merits - Basic Board
            
These boards are used to collect your tokens. Once you have earned some tokens you can right click on them to 'upload' them. When you have enough tokens to improve your board, you right click on the Token Board in your inventory and it will upgrade. Each upgrade will make the board give you better and new 'buffs' (increases in skills or stats).
            
·        Startup Maps - Clans

You have also been given a Map Crystal that contains some basic maps for the most visited cities of your side.


For Neutrals:

·        Startup Maps - Neutrals

You have also been given a Map Crystal that contains some basic maps for the most visited cities of your side.


Setting-up your MP for Battle: Basic IP Distribution

When you begin a new character in AO, you come to life with 1500 IP ready to distribute amongst your skills and abilities. The first thing to do is to use them. In the first few levels, the choices about IP Distribution are fairly straight-forward. 

·        Open the skill window by hitting U on your keyboard or clicking on the second button from the top on the left hand side of your chat window (the icon is like a graduation cap). 

In the skills window you see the Categories of skills as buttons on the left hand side. When you first open the window, the Abilities section is highlighted. By clicking on the other category buttons on the left hand side you can see all of the skills available in that category.

Here are the skills that you should definitely raise for the first few levels at least:

Abilities Category

Max your Strength
Max your Agility
Max your Stamina
Max your Intelligence
Max your Sense
Max your Psychic

Max your Body Dev Skill
Max your Nano Pool Skill

Body Category

Raise no skills in this section for now

Melee Category

The MP Shield weapon that you got in your inventory to start with is a melee weapon. By holding shift down and left clicking the shield you can see that the requirements to equip it are:

Wield: Metaphysicist

As a result, you do not have to raise any skills in order to equip this weapon. The weapon also buffs 3 important Armour Class (AC) types by a small amount.

However, your damage with the weapon will be improved by raising the skills quoted in the “Attack Skills” part of the weapon description. For the MP shield the attack skills are:

1h Blunt 100%

So by raising your 1 Hand Blunt skill (1HB) you could get better damage from the weapon.

The most important part of this weapon right now is the buffs that it gives you to your Armour Class. Many MP weapons are like this, in that they can often be more focussed on buffs than on damage.

At this level, the amount of points spent raising this skill is not great – still the benefit from raising the skill is also not great. My advice would be not to raise your 1 Hand Blunt skill at this time.

Raise no other skills in this section 

Misc Weapons Category

Raise no skills in this category

Ranged Category

Raise no skills in this category

Speed Category

Max your NanoC. Init (increases your speed of casting)

Max your Dodge-Rng (increases your ability to evade ranged weapons)

Max your Evade-ClsC (increases your ability to evade melee weapons)

Max your Run Speed (increases your speed of movement when running)

Protection Category

This section simply shows you your Armour Class (AC) ratings for different types of damage. You cannot allocate IP to ACs. They are raised by buffs or by equipping items.

Trade and Repair Category

Max your Comp. Liter (allows you to equip certain important items)

Nano and Aiding Category

This is the most important section for an MP. It includes the 6 Nano skills and two important ‘Aiding’ skills that are used for healing with the kits, labs, coils and spindles.

Max your Matt.Metam (Nanoskill)

Max your Bio Metamor (Nanoskill)

Max your Psycho Modi (Nanoskill)

Max your Matter Crea (Nanoskill)

Max your Time&Space (Nanoskill)

Max your Sensory Impr (Nanoskill)

Max your First Aid (Aiding)

Max your Treatment (Aiding)

Spying Category

Raise no skills in this category for now

Navigation Category

Max your Map Navigation skill (but no further than 130). This will allow you to upload mini-maps and get upgrades that allow you to see where players, your pets and mobs are.

Raise no other skills in this category.

Hit the accept button to save these changes.

You will notice that you still have quite a lot of IP left over after raising these skills. Do not be tempted to always use up all your IP every level during your first few levels. As you rise in level, you’ll find you have less and less IP to spare and will be glad of a few extra points that you saved.

These skills increases will be enough to get you through your first levels in the training ground.


Uploading your nanos
 
The MP starts off with two nano formula crystals. One is a nuke and one is an attack pet.

·        Click on the 3rd button down on the left of your chat window “Nanos”

You should see a window open called “Programs”. There are five buttons at the top of the window:

Combat
Medical
Prot
Psi
Space

These are the five different categories of Nanos in the game. Clicking on each of these buttons will reveal the different nanos available to you in that category. For now there are no nanos because you have not uploaded any yet.

·        Right click on the nano crystal “Meta-Physicist: Startup Crystal - Lesser Anger Manifestation”.

You should see the crystal disappear from your inventory. At the same time, a symbol will appear in one of the spaces in your Programs window and the view will automatically change to the “Space” view. All MP pet nanos belong to the Space Category of nanos.

·        Stand up (you must be standing to cast a nano)
·        Right click on the symbol in the Space Category

You will see a progress bar moving from left to right in the top left corner of your window. This is the nano casting. You will then see the bar disappear from right to left. This is the nano recharging. You must wait for each nano to recharge fully before you can cast another nano.

If you look around above your head somewhere now, you should see a bobbing brown-orange ball above your head with the name “Anger Manifestation above its head. You have successfully cast your first pet!

·        Right click on the nano crystal “Meta-Physicist: Startup Crystal - Mind Pain”

You should see another symbol pop up in your Programs window and the view should change to “Combat”. The Mind Pain nano is a nuke. When you target an opponent and cast this nano, it will do damage to the opponent as long as it lands its attack. If you’d like to see it work do the following:

·        Stand Up
·        Target yourself by hitting the F1 key
·        Right click on the Mind Pain icon in the programs window

Ouch! The damage done to you when you nuke yourself is approximately half the damage you would do to a mob. This is because in PvP the damage of a nuke is halved.

To heal your hitpoints and your nano do the following:

·        Sit down
·        Right click on your Treatment Lab (Rubika)
·        Right click on your Health Coil (Jobe)

At the top of the Programs Window, you can see on more button called “Favorites”. Clicking on this button brings up a new view. You can move nanos from the other five sections into your Favourites window so that you organise your most used nanos into one area.

·        Click on the Space Button
·        Click on the Anger Manifestation nano icon (the icon should stick to your cursor)
·        Click on the Favorites Button
·        Click on an empty space (the icon should drop into the space)

Equipping your items

In your basic inventory you got a Meta Shield, possibly a map crystal and possibly a Shirt. Now it’s time to equip them.

·        Hold down Ctrl key and hit the numeral 1 

You should see your “Wear” window open. Along the top of the window there are three ‘tabs’:

Weapons:

In this section, you can equip weapons, Heads Up Display items (HUD), Utility items (Utils) and Deck Items.

Armor:

In this section, you can equip armour, clothing, rings and bracers.

Implants:

In this section, you can equip implants.

There are two ways to equip an item. We’ll use both to equip your Meta Shield.

·        Click on the Weapons tab in the Wear window
·        Right click on the Meta Shield in your inventory

You should see a progress bar run from left to right in the top left corner of your window and the Shield will appear in your Right Hand slot on the weapons tab. When you equip an item by right clicking it, the item will go to its default slot.

·        Right Click on the Meta Shield in your Weapons tab

You should see a progress bar again and the Shield will appear in your inventory.

·        Left click on the Meta Shield in your inventory (the shield should stick to your cursor)
·        Move the shield to the Right Hand Slot in the Weapons Tab
·        Left Click the Right Hand Slot

You should see a progress bar run from left to right in the top left corner of your window and the Shield will appear in your Right Hand slot on the weapons tab. When you equip an item by moving it to a slot, you can choose which slot the item will go to – as long as the item is allowed to be equipped in that slot. To check which slots an item can equip to, shift-Left click on the item and you’ll find the correct slot(s) listed next to the “Loc:” heading.

Omni MPs should be able to equip their Shirt to the Clothing Tab of the “Wear” window.

MPs who began in Jobe should be able to equip their Jobe Bracer to either the Left Wrist or the Right Wrist.
Uploading your maps

The Map Crystal does not upload to a slot. Map Crystals make it so that you can see the area around you in your “Mini Map” window. By right clicking on the Map Crystal, the maps will upload automatically to the right spot. Maps cannot be unloaded once they are uploaded. You need to meet the Map Navigation requirement on a map crystal in order to upload it.

In Rubika, mini-map crystals are widely available for all areas. For Jobe and Shadowlands mini-maps use a different system.
Setting up your shortcut bar

When you first begin a character the following icons are shown in your Number 1 shortcut bar.

·        Start Combat    (you can also hit the Q key)
·        Walk                (you can also hit the Backspace key)
·        Stand               (you can also hit the X key)
·        Follow              (this is useful for following other players)
·        Exit                  (this exits the game)

The MP generally needs as many slots available as possible on the first bar. To clear up this bar you can either delete the icon (they can be replaced later if needed):

·        Pick the icon up by left clicking it and then delete the icon by right clicking somewhere on the screen outside the shortcut bar.

Or you can move the icons to the Number 2 shortcut bar:

·        Pick the icon up by left clicking it
·        Hold down the Shift key and press the number 2 
·        Then left click an empty slot to drop the icon onto that bar
·        To return to Number 1 shortcut bar – hold shift down and hit the number 1 key 

If your shortcut bar is not visible, hit the Y key on your keyboard.

Once you have cleared you Number 1 Shortcut bar, it’s time to put your own icons on there.

First we put your nanos onto the bar:

·        Open the Programs Window
·        Click on Combat
·        Left Click on Mind Pain icon to pick it up
·        Move to the Shortcut bar
·        Drop the icon onto the first slot
·        Click on Space in the Programs Window
·        Pick up the Anger Manifestation icon
·        Move to the Shortcut bar
·        Drop the icon onto the second slot

Then we put your healing items onto the shortcut bar:

·        Go to your inventory
·        Left Click on the Treatment Lab to pick it up (Coil in Jobe)
·        Move to the shortcut bar 
·        Drop the icon on the last slot
·        Left Click on the Startup First Aid Kit to pick it up
·        Drop the icon on the next to last slot on the bar

Now to try some of them out:

·        Stand up (hit X key)
·        Target yourself with F1
·        Hit the number 1 key 

By hitting the number 1 key, you activated the icon in the first slot of your shortcut bar and nuked yourself.

·        Target yourself with F1
·        Hit the number 9 key 

By hitting the number 9 key you activated the last but one icon on your shortcut bar. Each slot on the bar corresponds to a number key from 1 to 0.

·        Sit Down (hit X Key)
·        Hit the number 0 key 

This time you activated the Treatment Lab on the last slot of the bar.

Controlling your Pet

Earlier you cast your first pet – Anger Manifestation. He just sat next to you and didn’t do a great deal though. In order to get your pets to work for you, you need to be able to give them commands. This section will take you through how to basically control your Anger Manifestation.

First Cast the Anger Manifestation pet:

·        Stand up (with X key)
·        Either hit the number 2 key – or right click on the icon for the Anger Manifestation nano (this should cast your pet)
·        Now click on the Actions Button (top left button next to your chat window)
·        Next Click on the “Pets” button in the sub-menu
·        Next Click on the “Pet Info” button in the next menu.

You should see a new window open up on your screen. In the window you can see the Hitpoints bar of your pet with the pet’s name written in the red bar.

Next to the hitpoints bar of the pet, there are three buttons, which can be used to give commands to your pet:

·        The Attack Button will tell your pet to attack the currently selected target
·        The Follow Button will tell your pet to follow you
·        The Wait Button will tell your pet to wait where it is until you give it a new command

Try the following test:

·        Left click on the “Wait” button
·        Run a small distance away from your pet
·        Turn round to look at the pet
·        Left click on the “Follow” button

You can also put a series of pet commands onto your shortcut bar.

·        Open the Actions => Pets Menu again.

You’ll see a series of commands there:

Command
Effect
Follow
This command tells your pets to follow you. Pets will not defend you automatically when they are in follow mode.

Behind
This command tells your pets to move behind you and follow you. Pets will respond to attacks when in Behind mode.

Wait
This command tells your pets to wait where they are until you give them a new command. They will not do anything except wait there whatever happens.

Guard
This command tells your pets to guard you. If anything attacks you, your pets will automatically attack your attacker. Your pets will also move along with you when not fighting.

Attack
This command tells your pets to attack your currently selected target

Hunt
This command tells your pets to move to the nearest enemy target and begin trying to kill it. After the target is dead the pet will move to the next enemy target and try to kill it etc – until you stop it with another command.

Terminate
This tells your pet to deactivate itself. It disappears and you’ll have to cast a new pet.

Report
This command will give you feedback in your chat window about the health, nano, NCU used/free, time left before the pet times out, location and fighting target.

Heal
This command tells the pet to heal your currently selected target. You’ll need to level some more before being able to cast a Heal Pet though.



To move one of these commands to your shortcut bar:

·        Left click and hold down on the command you want
·        Drag the mouse away from the menu
·        After a second or two an icon for the command will appear on your cursor
·        Drop the icon onto the desired slot on the shortcut bar

For now the most important commands that you might want on your shortcut bar are:

·        Attack
·        Follow
·        Guard
·        Report

You can also use all of the above listed commands by simply typing them into the chat window. You need to precede each of the commands with “/pet [command].

·        Hit Enter key to open a chat entry box
·        Type /pet guard
·        The pet should respond in the chat that he is guarding

You can also put a command on your shortcut bar by typing a command into the chat window. This time, you preced the command with “/macro ButtonName [command]

·        Hit Enter key to open a chat entry box
·        Type /macro GuardMe /pet guard
·        An icon called “Guardme” should appear at your cursor
·        Drop the icon onto the shortcut bar
·        Clicking the shortcut will now run the command /pet guard

Also, hit F10 to get into Options. Then select Chat section. Ensure that you have enabled “My pets hit by/hitting others”. This allows you to see the damage done by and to your pets in the chat window.




Your First Battle

Right – let’s go kill stuff. J

The basic tactic for an MP is to:

1.      Stand at a distance from your target. 
2.      Target the mob (either by tabbing until your target is selected or left clicking on the target itself)
3.      For your first battle, make sure that the colour of your target’s indicator (top right in your screen) is a Green Colour
4.      Tell your pet to attack.
5.      Wait until the pet has hit the target mob – you’ll see his damage appear in your chat
6.      Make sure the mob is still targeted
7.      Then cast your Mind Pain nuke (if you’re out of range, move a little closer to the mob then try again)
8.      When the nuke recharge bar is gone, cast your nuke again
9.      Repeat until the mob is dead
10.  Keep an eye on your attack pet’s health
11.  If the pet looks like it might die – then move in closer to the mob and hit the Q key to help the pet by hitting with your shield

If you begin to get hit by the mob or if you run out of nanopool to cast your nuke:

1.      Stop nuking the mob with Mind Pain
2.      Stop hitting the mob with your shield (hit Q again to stop attacking)
3.      Target yourself by hitting F1
4.      Hit the number 9 key to activate your First Aid Kit (Spindle)

This will heal your health and nano a little bit and when you stop attacking the mob, your pet stands a better chance of pulling the attention of the mob away from you. If suitable, you can target the mob again and begin attacking it once more.

If it looks like you are in danger of dying:

1.      Run back to the safe area where you first started – next to the Guard
2.      The Guard will kill your attacker for you

In between fights:

1.      Sit down and use a Treatment Lab (Coil) to refresh your nano and HP
2.      Wait until your attack pet has recovered enough HP for the next battle (Note: you cannot heal your attack pet yet but it will heal itself slowly over time
3.      If your pet needs to recover a lot of health, use the /pet terminate command to kill your pet and simply cast a fresh new one.



Some useful things to know about MP combat

Your attack range

When you fight a mob as an MP in the training ground, you must be close enough to use the tool with which you are attacking.

All nanos in the game have a “Range” limitation. You need to be in range in order to cast the nano. 

All weapons in the game have a “Range” limitation. You need to be in range in order to start and attack and hit with the weapon.

You can find the range information in the description for the nano or item. Shift Left-Click on the item or nano icon in order to see the description.

When you select a fighting target, the ends of the target “Con” will be grey when the target is out of range. The ends of the target “Con” will be red when the target is in range.

Pet fighting range

You need to be within a certain range of your target to be able to command the pet to attack. You also need to be within a certain range of your pet to be able to give it commands. Once you’ve told your pet to attack something you can usually take a few more steps away from the battle in order to put more distance between you and the battle.

If you get too far away from the battle where your pet is attacking the mob (50 metres in the game measures), then the health bar for your pet in the Pet Window will begin flashing and your pet will give up the battle with the mob and come running back to you. However, the mob will still be fighting and will come back with the pet and probably aggro (attack) you!

When your pet gives up a battle like this he forgets any commands. So in order to make him fight again, you need to tell him to attack a target that is in range again. It’s a good idea to choose his original target again or you’ll have two mobs to fight which can be a little difficult to handle in the training ground.

Agg/Def Bar

Your Agg/Def Bar sets your aggressiveness and defensiveness. It is a slider in the interface which runs from Def at the left to Agg at the right.

At the Defensive end of the scale:

·        Your nanos will cast slower

·        Your weapons will attack more slowly

·        You will be less likely to be attacked by a mob

·        You will be less likely to get hit for very high damage (Critical Hits)

·        You will be less likely to hit the mob for very high damage (Critical Hits)



At the Aggressive end of the scale:

·        Your nanos will cast faster

·        Your weapons will attack more quickly

·        You will be more likely to be attacked by a mob

·        You will be more likely to get hit for very high damage (Critical Hits)

·        You will be more likely to hit the mob for very high damage (Critical Hits)



Aggro and Mob Hatelists

Basically, whenever you tell your pet to attack a mob (monster), you’ll get onto his hatelist. This is a list of targets that the mob keeps track of and will want to attack. The mob will check from time to time to see you he hates the most and will then attack the target he decides that he hates most. Some of the things that can affect your position on the mob’s hatelist are:

·        How much damage you have done to the mob

·        What nanos you have cast at the mob

·        How close you are to the mob

·        Whether you are in Line of Sight (LoS) of the mob.

·        Your Agg/Def setting

·        How strong or weak you are compared to your pets. Sometimes the mob will cleverly choose to attack the weakest of its opponents!

·        How many times you have hit the mob

So, if you get attacked by a mob and need to make the aggro go back to your pet there are several options:

·        stop doing damage with your own weapon, 

·        stop casting nanos, 

·        move away from and if possible out of sight of the mob, 

·        reduce your Agg/Def setting

·        Use pet buffs to make your attack pet do more damage

·        etc

Some mobs will attack you on sight. Usually, if a mob is grey they won’t attack you on sight. But other types of mobs will aggro you the moment you come in range of them. You’ll soon grow to learn which types of mobs will aggro you and which will let you pass by without even noticing you.

Also, some mobs are Social. This means that when you attack one of them, he sends out a cry of help to his friends and if some of them are in range, they will come and help him. These additional mobs who join a battle are called by the players “Adds”. Adds can be quite dangerous. You may attack a single mob and suddenly find that you have 3 or 4 mobs trying to kill you at once. 

Most of the mobs in the Training Grounds will not aggro you on sight and will not Social aggro either – but not all mobs in the Training Grounds are that easy to deal with. Later in the tactics section you’ll find out more about how to deal with these situations. For now it’s enough to know that you’ll have to choose your targets with some care.

Later sections in this guide on Team and Solo tactics for the MP will detail more advanced techniques on managing mob aggro.


Mob Difficulty Information

When you target a mob an indicator for the mob will appear at the top right of your screen. This is the “Con”. The colour of the con will indicate how difficult the mob is to battle for you at your level.

Grey
Indicates a very easy mob to kill alone. You will get only 1 experience point (XP) for these mobs.
Green
Indicates a mob that should be easy for you to kill alone and you will get proper experience points for killing it.
Yellow
Indicates a mob that should be about as tough as you are. These mobs will give more experience for you.
Red
Indicates a mob that will be very difficult to kill alone. You should probably avoid such mobs for now.

When you have a mob targeted you can also hit the “T” key on your keyboard to bring up some information about the mob. For most Grey to Yellow mobs, the information will tell you the exact Level of the mob and there will be a short text telling you how difficult the mob is to kill for you alone. Red mobs may not give you an exact level indication – but instead just tell you that it’s very much higher level than you are.

During your time soloing in the Training Ground you may find it easier and even quicker to choose green or greenish-yellow mobs to fight. As a beginning MP you won’t have learnt all of the tactics that you need to fight very well with your pets yet. You may find it less frustrating if you get to know the tricks and foibles of your attack pet and the mobs, before challenging the more difficult mobs on your own.

The mob information may also tell you which “Side” or “Faction” alignments the mob has. Side will appear on mobs in Rubika and will tell you whether the mobs are Omni, Neutral or Clan.

You’ll learn more about faction in the special section below about the Jobe Training Ground.

Experience Points (XP) and Looting

When you and your pet kill a mob, you will see a chat message telling you that you got Experience Points. These points add up in your XP bar in the Stats window. You’ll also be able to right click the corpse of the mob you’ve just killed and a Loot Window will open up. Any Credits (money) on the corpse will automatically be added to your own pocket when you open the corpse. Click on the items in the Loot Window to move them into your inventory.

Once your XP bar is full you’ll gain a new level. Each time you gain a level you’ll receive more IP and you’ll be able to raise your skills more. For the first 5 to 10 levels, stick to the IP distribution schema mentioned above. More detailed information on IP choices and how to make them come later in this guide.

Looting corpses provides you with your best and only source of income in the Training Ground, so it’s important that you loot everything you can find. Some of the items that you find in the training ground may well be useful items that you want to keep. Other items that you find in the Training Ground will be items that you will sell to vendors and shops in order to make some money.


Teaming with Other Players

AO is a game which is designed mostly for team play. A team is a group of up to six players who join together to fight. It can be very advantageous to work together with others in AO because each profession brings their own special skills and abilities to the team.

To form a team, it’s generally a good idea to ask the player if they’d like to join – either in vicinity chat or with a /tell message. You’ll also find a chat channel called either “OT Seeking Team 1 – 10” if you are Omnitek sided or “Clan Seeking Team 1 – 10” if you are Clan sided – or both of them if you are Neutral or in Jobe. You can offer yourself for teaming in those channels, including your level and your profession.

To start a team:

·        Open your Team window by clicking on the 5th button from the top on the right hand side of your chat window.

·        Target the player you’d like to invite to a team

·        Click on the “Recruit” button in your team window

·        The player will get a text message that he’s been invited to a team

·        When the player opens his team window he’ll have 3 options: Accept, Refuse or Ignore

·        By clicking Accept he will join the team. You will see his name, health bar and nanopool bar appear in your team window

·        By clicking Refuse a text message is sent to the Recruiter to say you’ve refused

·        By clicking Ignore he will set the Recruiter in question to ignore and no longer receive any messages or invites that he tries to send.

When teaming, you should try to work together as a team to kill the same mob. It’s usually a good idea for everybody in the team to concentrate on killing the same mob. You’ll find some detailed team tactics later in this guide. For now though, simply working together to kill one mob at a time should be enough of a tactic in the Training Ground.


Training Ground Details

Clan Training Ground

You appear in this area next to the Guard on a small paved section. Just next to you, you should find the following machines:

Startup Shop

The Startup Shop sells some basic items which may be of use to you once you have made some money. Importantly, you can also sell any items you may loot from mobs to this shop in order to make some money. The Startup Shop should sell

·        Basic Nano Recharger (QL 1)

This kit is similar to your sit-down start-up treatment lab, but it only heals your nanopool. Instead of healing your nano for only 15 points, it will heal for 30 points. Since nano is the source of your nuke power and your pets, purchasing a stack of these may well be a good idea as you will find that you are able to kill mobs in the training ground more efficiently and with less waiting time between mobs.

·        Simple First-Aid Kit (QL 1)

This is similar to your start up First Aid kit, but it will only heal your HP. Instead of healing for 5 to 7 points while in combat, it will heal your HP for 10 to 12 points.

·        Treatment Laboratory (QL 1)

This is simlar to the Basic Nano Recharger but heals your HP while sitting in peace for 30 points.

·        Omni-Tek Application Form

This can be used to change your side to an Omni-Tek – but you should be very careful to use this only in a safe place, otherwise the Clan guards may well kill you.

·        Clan Application Form
This can be used to change your side to Clan – but you should be very careful to use this in a safe place otherwise Omni guards may kill you.

·        Floating Torch

Floating torches can be equipped and shine weak light around you for a short distance. They are near useless in nearly all situations.

·        Lockpick

A lockpick is a useful item that opens Doors, chests and other things using the Breaking and Entry skill. 

·        Mission Key Duplicator

A mission key duplicator can be very handy. It allows you to copy a mission key given only to yourself and pass the keys to other members of your team so that they can enter the same mission as you.

·        Nano Programming Interface

The nano programming interface is a useful tool that can be equipped to give you a small nano programming buff and can be used in some tradeskill processes.

Random Name Generator Machine

The Random Name Generator does just what it sounds like. Using the machine will allow you to let the game choose a random first and last name for your character – your Nickname will stay the same though. If you’d prefer to choose your own name, type 

/name help 

which will give you details of how to create and change your name.

Combat Areas

The Clan training ground is essentially made up of 3 combat areas. The first area, where the Guard is, is a large rectangular area with a waterfall and pond in it. You’ll find the following mobs in this section:

·        Leets
·        Reets of Paradise
·        Viviparous Lizard
·        Rollerrats

This section should be fine for you to fight mobs until you reach level 3. They are  not “social” which means that the mobs will not help each other to try to kill you. In the northern end of this section you may find Rollerrats though. These mobs here are “aggro” which means they will attack you if you get close to them, even if you do not attack them first. They should still be pretty easy for you to kill though.

To the East of the guarded area where you appear, through a stone doorway, you’ll find a second area. This one is square and has slightly harder mobs to kill. You might want to head this way once you are level 3. The following mobs can be found in this area:

·        Grain Blubbag
·        Daft Raider
·        Eleet

You’ll also find a deep red non-player character (NPC) called the “Second Hand Peddler”. If you right click on the peddler you will bring up a conversation dialogue where you can choose questions and get information about weapons, ammunition, armour and some gadgets. The peddler can also sell you some of these items if you have enough money. You can also sell your items to the peddler.

To the North of this section, in the North East corner of the training ground you’ll find the most difficult mobs to fight:

·        Reet Warbler
·        Grecko
·        Contagious Rollerrat
·        Dayflare the Inferno

The last mob in this list “Dayflare the Inferno” is a Boss Mob. Boss mobs are very tough mobs that are difficult to kill alone. They have special loot that can be very nice indeed. In general, mobs with ‘special’ names like this will be boss mobs and you should be very careful indeed when trying to kill them – especially if you are alone and not in a team.

Training Ground Loot

In general, the loot in the training ground will be small things like pieces of armour, monster parts and so forth. You may be able to equip some of the armour that you find though you may prefer to sell these items to collect money so that you can purchase the armour of your choice at a later time. 

Of particular interest are the “Take me to the Shop” items, which will give you a relatively large amount of money when you sell them to the shop or vendor.

Apartment Complex Area

At the paved area where the Guard is, you will also find a stone doorway with a sign above it “Exit to City”. This exit takes you from the combat area to the Apartment Complex Area or Backyard. In the backyard you’ll find a guide who can give you information about how to play the guide and can give you some tasks or to do in order to help you get to know the game. Following some of these tasks is a very good way to get a feel for how to play the game.

In this section you’ll find several useful machines.

·        Clan Mission Booth

The mission booth is a machine that allows you to pull ‘missions’ which are like small quests. Right click on the machine to use it.

Each time you ask for missions, you’ll need to pay an amount of credits equal to your level. The mission booth will offer you several missions of which you can accept one. You can repeat the process up to 9 times in theory as you have a total of 9 mission slots available to you although it is rarely useful to take more than one mission in this area because the missions are all located through a door just to the right of booth and so it’s easy to come back and get another.

Missions are often a good source of both XP and loot, so it’s a good idea to do at least a few missions from this terminal before leaving the training ground areas.

·        Federated Cell Structure Scanner

At the very early levels, there are no real penalties to dying. All of your experience and items are ‘saved’ for you. As you increase in level though, you’ll find that dying can potentially lose you XP and that you have to wait a certain period of time after dying before you can reclaim most of your inventory items.

The Cell Structure Scanner is a machine that you use to ‘save’ your present state. Where you save will also determine where you resurrect after dying. Each usage of this machine costs you credits. Certainly for the time when you are in the training ground you are unlikely to really need to save.

·        Stationary Automated Surgery Clinic

The Surgery Clinic is a machine which when used (cost is 300 credits) allows you to put in and remove implants. Using it also gives you a +100 buff to your treatment skill allowing you to more easily put in higher quality implants.

·        Bank Terminal

The bank is where you can keep items that you wish to save but cannot fit into your inventory. Simply access it by right clicking on it and you’ll see a Ban k Window open. Move items from your inventory to the bank window by picking them up and dropping them into the window. Recover items from the bank by simply clicking on them.

·        Reclaim Terminal

As mentioned earlier, when you die at higher levels, the items from your inventory are not immediately available to you. You can recover these items by finding a reclaim terminal and right clicking on it to open it and retrieve your items.

Apartment Doors

By entering an apartment door you create an apartment for yourself. Apartments have little real function at present in AO so for now it’s probably wise not to enter these doors. At a later time, when you are sure which city you prefer to live in you may want to get an apartment for yourself. 

Exit to City

Also in the Apartment Complex area you’ll find an “Exit to the City”. This exit takes you out into the city proper. Just beneath the sign you’ll see a sign with a number on it. This is the number of your training ground. Should you wish to return to the training ground where you started, you’ll need to find the correspondingly numbered “Appartment Complex” door in the city. It’s not necessary to return to the same training ground should you want to go back to a training ground – but from time to time you may want to get into a particular training ground in this way.

Omni Tek Training Ground

You appear in this area next to the Guard on a small paved section. Just next to you, you should find the following machines:

Startup Shop

The Startup Shop sells some basic items which may be of use to you once you have made some money. Importantly, you can also sell any items you may loot from mobs to this shop in order to make some money. The Startup Shop should sell

·        Treatment Laboratory (QL 1)

This is simlar to the Basic Nano Recharger but heals your HP while sitting in peace for 30 points.

·        Omni-Tek Application Form

This can be used to change your side to an Omni-Tek – but you should be very careful to use this only in a safe place, otherwise the Clan guards may well kill you.

·        Clan Application Form
This can be used to change your side to Clan – but you should be very careful to use this in a safe place otherwise Omni guards may kill you.

·        Floating Torch

Floating torches can be equipped and shine weak light around you for a short distance. They are near useless in nearly all situations.

Combat Areas

The Omni training ground is essentially made up of 1 large combat area and one small one. The first area is immediately around the Guide area without going over water You’ll find the following mobs in this section:

·        Leets
·        Reets of Paradise
·        Grass Snake
·        Fresh Clan Functionary

This section should be fine for you to fight mobs until you reach level 3. They are  not “social” which means that the mobs will not help each other to try to kill you. In the northern end of this section you may find Fresh Clan Functionaries though. These mobs are “aggro” which means they will attack you if you get close to them, even if you do not attack them first. They should still be pretty easy for you to kill though.

To the East of the guarded area where you appear, around the side of a water area, you’ll find some tougher mobs. This one is square and has slightly harder mobs to kill. You might want to head this way once you are level 3. The following mobs can be found in this area:

·        Daft Clan Diversionist
·        Eleet

You’ll also find a deep red non-player character (NPC) called the “Second Hand Peddler”. If you right click on the peddler you will bring up a conversation dialogue where you can choose questions and get information about weapons, ammunition, armour and some gadgets. The peddler can also sell you some of these items if you have enough money. You can also sell your items to the peddler.

To the North of this section, in the North East corner of the training ground you’ll find the most difficult mobs to fight. To get there either swim across the water or work your way around the water northwards until you reach the bridge. The following mobs can be found in this section:

·        Tiny Stalker
·        Daft Clan Informer
·        Young Malle
·        Smooth Snake
·        Examiner Nosolea the Elder

Of particular interest are the “Take me to the Shop” items, which will give you a relatively large amount of money when you sell them to the shop or vendor.

Apartment Complex Area

At the paved area where the Guide and Guard are, you will also find a blue light teleporter with a sign above it “Exit to City”. This exit takes you from the combat area to the Apartment Complex Area or Backyard. In the backyard you’ll find a guide who can give you information about how to play the guide and can give you some tasks or to do in order to help you get to know the game. Following some of these tasks is a very good way to get a feel for how to play the game.

·        34-I Helper
·        Biofreak Carcass

Also in the backyard area you’ll find an “Exit to the City” (at the very northern end). This exit takes you out into the city proper.



Jobe Training Ground

When you appear in the Jobe Training Ground you are high up in the sky on a platform. Across the long bridge you come to the combat area which ranges a long way on either side and in most directions. At the other end of the bridge you’ll find the guarded area with two guards standing there. Generally, the further away from this guarded area you go the harder the mobs will be to kill.

Mobs you will find in the Jobe Training Ground are listed below along with their levels which will give you an idea of how difficult they are to kill:

·        Deceitful Weaver (level 1-3)

Massive Waggler (level 6)
The Dryad Watcher (level 8) 
The Predator Rager (level 6) 
Leader of the Pack (level 5) 
Crippler Fiend (level 6) 
Hardened Mortig (level 8) 
The Devastator (level 10+)

In Shadowlands, there is an important element called Faction. Faction is essentially a side that you take based on the actions that you do in the game and the mobs that you kill. There are three general factions:

Redeemed: Usually connected to the Clan side from Rubika

Unredeemed: Usually connected to the OmniTek side from Rubika

Ergo: Usually connected to the Neutral side from Rubika

By starting in Jobe you are automatically Neutral to begin with. However, you will have to choose a Rubika side at some point and that choice may affect which “Faction” you choose to aim for. Since faction points are won by choosing certain mobs to kill and also by choosing which quests you do in the Shadowlands, it’s important that you kill the right mobs and do the right quests in the Jobe training ground. When you kill faction aligned mobs in the training ground you will receive faction points in the opposite faction and may lose faction points in the faction of the mob.

Mobs that have Faction in the training ground are:

Hai-Tempterus (level 6-7)
Aligned to Redeemed factions: The Devoted, The Benign Conservers

Tempterus (level 6-7) 
Aligned to Unredeemed factions: The Followers of the Temple, The Assertive Operators

Boss Mobs:

Guardian of Crystals (level 8) 
Aligned to The Followers of the Temple, the Unredeemed

Watcher of Woods (level 8) 
Aligned to the Devoted, the Redeemed)

El-Domo, the Forest Ranger (level 10) 
Aligned to the Devoted, the Redeemed

Celeth-El, the Crystal Guardian (level 8) 
Aligned to The Followers of the Temple, the Unredeemed

This guide cannot begin to detail the very complex Faction System and all of the ins and outs. You may need to do more research in order to make a definite choice about which faction you want to follow. 

Also in the guarded area just over the bridge is a Non-Player Character (NPC) called Sundance Smith J.A.M.E. Depot. This character is a vendor and is able to sell you many very useful items, most in three different quality levels. Below you’ll find a listing of some of the items available from this vendor. Please refer to the next section of this guide where the “First Shopping Lists” are discussed and explained in order to get an idea of what you may need to buy.

·        NCU Chips

These very important items can be equipped into the slots on Belt Component Platforms to increase the number of NCU that you have available. NCU is a key element for the MP.

·        Advanced Hacker Tool

Advanced Hacker Tools can be used to break open items as part of tradeskill (crafting) processes. These processes usually use Breaking and Entry as their skill which is not a strength of MPs.

·        Ammunition

·        Belt Component Platform Ti-100x

The Belt Component Platform is equipped by a player in order to carry various items in its ‘slots’. For the MP this is of particular interest for increasing NCU by equipping NCU chips into the slots.

·        Bomb Disarmament Tool

This tool is used in disarming bombs and booby trapped items.

·        Floating Torch

Floating torches can be equipped and shine weak light around you for a short distance. They are near useless in nearly all situations.

·        Lockpick

A lockpick is a useful item that opens Doors, chests and other things using the Breaking and Entry skill. 

·        Medium Backpack

Backpacks are items which take up a single slot in your inventory. By opening the backpack by right clicking on it and moving items to the backpack you are able to carry many more items around with you.

·        Nano Programming Interface

The nano programming interface is a useful tool that can be equipped to give you a small nano programming buff and can be used in some tradeskill processes.

·        Screwdriver

A screwdriver is an item that is used in several tradeskill processes to create other items. 

·        Small Backpack

Backpacks are items which take up a single slot in your inventory. By opening the backpack by right clicking on it and moving items to the backpack you are able to carry many more items around with you.

·        Sundance Armour pieces

This special armour is specially made for beginners. The armour only requires a certain level in order to be able to wear it and is available up to Quality Level 15 which has a level 15 requirement to equip it. Sundance Armour increases your armour class and also adds a small amount of NCU to your available space.


Just near to your beginning point is a Non-Player Character (NPC) called Scientist Drake Rodriguez. By moving close to him you will automatically begin a conversation with him in which he wants to get started on several tests with you. These tests are essentially ‘learning quests’ which help you to learn the basics of Shadowlands elements and gameplay. There are 6 tests to complete, each of which will reward you with useful items, experience and loot.

·        Test of Strength 

Kill 3 mobs: 
 
Deceitful Weaver (level 1-3)
Shining Coiler (level 1-3)
Beit Gras (level 4) 

Reward: Bracer of Strength


·        Test of Agility and Stamina 

Find 3 different mobs and use a bio scanner (supplied) on them.
 
Hungry Predator (level 3) 
Lurking Chimera (level 4) 
Pond Dryad (level 6) 
 
The mission is in 3 parts, and you only have 2 minutes for each section. 


Reward:
 
Protective Shirt of Exploration  (Non Shades)
Tattoo of Inner Peace (Shades)



·        Test of Sense: 

Go to the other end of the bridge in the training area and use Search action to find a hidden Shadowleet. Target it, then return for your reward. 
 
Reward: Overview of Nascence Map Nano Crystal



·        Test of Psychic 


You will get 2 quests and must choose to do one or the other: 


Redeemed Quest: Find El-Domo, the Forest Ranger (level 10) (aligned to the Devoted, the Redeemed). She will ask you to find a lost Young Silvertail (level 5) and use a rag with the scent of it's herd to allow it to find it's way home. 

Unredeemed Quest: Find Celeth-El, the Crystal Guardian (level 8) (aligned to The Followers of the Temple, the Unredeemed). He will ask you to "take care" of a Silvertail Mare (level 2) that is threatening them because she believes they have taken her foal. 

Reward: Ring of Enhanced Psychic



·        Test of Intelligence 


Take some supplies to Scientist Sarah Willis who is hidden in a cave. 


Reward: Bonfire Kit



·        Final Test 
 
Find some information out in the Brink and bring it back. The item you are looking for is dropped by a Heckler of Evolution (level 5). 

Reward:  Smart Backpack 

Exit to Jobe Research and Jobe

At the northern end of the guarded area you will find an elevator that you can stand on which will take you up to the door to Jobe Research and the outside world. Jobe Research is the beginning of the Shadowlands adventure. The first city that you can reach is the city of Jobe. To get to the city of Jobe run down the long staircase and just around the corner to the left you will find a door which will teleport you up to the city of Jobe.

To return to the Jobe Research and the training ground you can right click on your Bracer of Jobe to teleport there. This teleport function only works until you reach level 11.
Section 3 – First Steps outside the Training Ground/Backyard

When to leave 

Rubika Training grounds

The training grounds in Rubika are primarily designed to get your character started in the world. You can leave the training ground (or Backyard as they are commonly called) when you are level 2 or when you have collected 1000 credits. However, the world outside the training grounds is enormous and it can be quite challenging to find your way around and you might well find yourself in danger from time to time. 

On the whole, as a beginner, you shouldn’t leave the training ground before you are at least level 5. This will give you a chance to get the combat basics sorted out and to have raised your skills to a reasonable level. Also, at around this point in time you will need to buy some new nanos to get new pets, nukes and your first buffs – all of which are available in shops in the cities.

Once you have left the Rubika training grounds there is little reason to return there on the whole. You will be able to find better hunting grounds, pull better missions with more interesting rewards, find teams more easily and so on, by exploring the world outside the training grounds.

Shadowlands Training grounds

The Shadowlands training grounds are more extensively designed than the Rubika training grounds and offer you the opportunity to begin working on your quests, faction as well as your levels. You can first leave the Shadowlands training ground at level 5 and this is the best time to do so. At this time you will need to go to the city of Jobe where you can buy your first nanos and also look around other shops and meet more people.

Once you have left the Shadowlands training ground though, there will still be elements of the training ground that you may not have completed. You should certainly complete all of the Drake quests and there are mobs in the Shadowlands training ground that will still allow you to level at a good pace. 

Also, you cannot leave the Shadowlands to move to Rubika until you are level 10 so your further hunting will need to be done in the Shadowlands. In particular as a beginner you may find the first outdoor hunting grounds in the Shadowlands a bit of a challenge at level 5 and you may prefer to advance a few more levels in the training ground before heading out into the wider Shadowlands world.
Shopping in the outside world 
 
Your first major job when you leave the training ground will be shopping for new nanos and setting up your character with various items and equipment that are easy to get and will affect your character strongly. The biggest issue with this will probably be getting together enough credits to be able to afford all of the things that you will need. For details on how best to make money as a beginner in AO, please refer to the New Arrivals forum where you’ll find the following thread at the top of the forum:

* * * Newbie-Style FAQ Guide * * *
 
In the index of that thread you’ll find a link to “Making lots of money”. It’s certainly worth a good read for any player starting a new character. 

This section will help you with how you should make decisions about what to buy and will also give you a complete basic first shopping list of items that you might want to purchase at level 5 (assuming you have the money to do so).

Upgrades and the MP

The MP is a profession that does a lot of shopping. The way that the MP works means that in order to get the most out of their tools, MPs must upgrade their nanos and equipment quite often. The key elements for an MP are the Nano Crystals which create the pets, act as nukes and debuffs and cast the MP buffs. There are a lot of nanos to purchase for the MP and so you’ll find yourself purchasing nano crystals a lot - or completing missions to get them.

Also, the MP is lucky enough to get several nanos which when cast on a player, increase the nanoskills. Nanos that increase skills or stats are called Buffs. For the MP this means that by buffing yourself you will be able to cast better versions of your own nanos. Unfortunately, there is a limit to the number of buffs that you can cast on yourself. Each buff takes up a certain number of NCU and once all of your NCU are used up you won’t be able to fit any new buffs in. As a result, the more NCU you have, the more you can buff yourself and the better the nanos you can cast – so upgrading your NCU can be an important factor.

On top of all of this, the game of AO is basically a skill based game and one of the key ways of increasing your skills is through Implants/Symbiants. These are special items you equip which give you increases to your skills. Because the MP uses nanos, it’s important for the MP to have high skills during combat rather than just having high skills in order to equip items or weapons. As a result, it’s important for MPs to upgrade their implants regularly to get the best out of their tools.

Making Buying Decisions

In general, whatever you are buying there is a process you need to think through:

·        Check your skill levels for uploading nanos or equipping items that you would like to have

This is done simply by looking in your skills window. If you haven’t maxed the skill that you’ll need and you have some IP left over, then you might want to check how high you could reach by investing those IP.

If you’re looking forward a few levels, then you can use tools such as the Rustot Skill Emulator to predict what your maximum skill levels will be.

·        Find out how much you can increase your skills 

For some items and nanos you may be able to increase your skills temporarily in order to be able to equip them. Buffs from other players, implants that you put in for a short period and items that you equip for a short period of time may all help you to equip an item that you need.

On the whole, this doesn’t work well for nanos. You’ll usually want to use nanos during your normal play and so temporary skills increases will not work well. For some nanos that have very long durations it can be worthwhile to use buffs from other players to cast them.

For some key equipment such as NCU Chips and Armour, there are no problems with using temporary buffs to equip them.

·        Research which nanos and items you can actually use at this time based on the maximum skills you can reach

Once you’ve worked out the maximum skills you can reach, then it’s time to find out which items you actually want to get. Sometimes you’ll find that you can skip nanos because you will already be able to reach a more powerful version of the type of nano. Sometimes you’ll have a choice of different QLs (quality levels) of an item and you can upgrade to a higher version than you thought.

Using online databases (such as Anarchy Mainframe ) which detail all of the items and nanos in the game is often a good way of working out which items you actually want and in which QL. 

·        Find out where to buy or find the nanos and items

Many items are available in the shops. Some items can be earned as rewards for completing missions or quests. Other items must be looted from the corpses of special mobs. Once you know which item you actually want, then it’s time to find out where to actually get the item.

It’s often possible to buy, barter, beg or borrow the items you want from other players too. 

·        Check that you have enough money

When buying items from shops or from other players you’ll need to get an idea of how much the items are going to cost and try to make sure that you’ll have enough funds. In particular, when you are shopping for a specific QL of an item, you may have only a limited window of opportunity to buy it when you find it – so it’s best to have the money all ready just in case the specific item you want turns up.

·        Acquire the items

Go get the item. J

·        Upload the nanos or equip the items

According to your plan, get the equipment and buffs that you’ll need to be able to equip the items and then equip them.

Getting Nanos

Nanos are the lifeblood of the MP. As a beginning MP, most of the nanos you might need can be found in the Nano Department of Basic Shops in the cities. There are two shop machines that will be important for you:

·        The Meta-Physicist Nano machine

The MP machine sells only specifically MP nanos. It’s here that you’ll find most of the important nanos throughout your life as an MP.

·        The General Nano machine

The General Nano machine sells a whole range of low level nanos that can be used to buff nearly all of the skills in the game by a small amount. Most of these buffs are available in two different versions:

o       Proficiencies which buff the skill for +10

o       Expertises which buff the skill for +20

Shadowlands nanos which can only be used once you’ve completed special quests in the Shadowlands can usually be purchased from the Garden and Sanctuary vendors in the Shadowlands playfields. You’ll find more details on these nanos and vendors in the MP Toolset section of this guide.

Some MP nanos cannot be purchased at the shops. To get these nanos you may have to purchase them from another player or go out and hunt and kill mobs in order to acquire them. There are a few general ways of getting these nanos:

·        Missions

When you pull missions from a mission terminal it’s possible to see what the reward is for completing the mission. Some MP nanos that are not available in the shops can be earned as a mission reward. It can be time consuming pulling a mission for the exact item you want though, so many players use a special utility that will help automate the search process called Clicksaver. 

·        Normal Mob Loot

Many MP nanos can be looted from normal mobs. These can save you the cost of buying them at the store and some of the nanos lootable from normal mobs are also not available in the shops. On the whole though this is the least reliable way of getting hold of nanos that you want – but if you find them ahead of the time you need them it’s the most cost efficient way of getting nanos.

·        Special Boss Mob Loot

Several MP nanos can only be found by killing special boss mobs. These tend to be particularly powerful nanos and are the exception rather than being the rule.

·        Quests

At present only a very few nanos are available as a Quest reward. Some Shadowlands MP nanos can only be used when you have completed quests though and can only be bought from Vendors in special places in the Shadowlands. Details of these nanos and vendors can be found in the MP Toolset section of this guide.

Extending your NCU

You start life with 8 NCU. In order to extend this, you need to equip a Belt Component Platform. There are 6 different types of NCU Belt or Belt Deck:

·        Belt Component Platform Ti-100X (gives 1 belt slot)
·        Belt Component Platform Ti-200X   (gives 2 belt slots)
·        Belt Component Platform 300X  (gives 3 belt slots)
·        Belt Component Platform 4IX    (gives 4 belt slots)
·        Belt Component Platform 5000  (gives 5 belt slots)
·        Belt Component Platform 6K-X     (gives 6 belt slots)

Each of the slots in a belt can hold a single item. There are several items that can be equipped into these slots, the most important of which are NCU chips which extend your available NCU. There are several different types of NCU chip but the basic ones come in various sizes:

·        2 - 3 NCU Memory 
·        4 - 7 NCU Memory 
·        8 - 15 NCU Memory  
·        16 - 31 NCU Memory
·        32 - 63 NCU Memory 
·        64 NCU Memory 
 
The different quality levels of the NCU chips will define exactly how much NCU each chip will give you. You’ll want to make sure you get enough chips to fill the available slots in your belt.

Both Belts and NCU Chips require a certain level of the Computer Literacy skill to be able to equip them. 


Buying, Building and Looting Implants/Symbiants

Implants (and symbiants for Shadowlands MPs) are key ways for MPs to increase their skills. There are three ways to get hold of implants:

·        Buy Pre-Made implants

In the basic shops in AO, there is a special department with machines for each profession that sells pre-made implants up to QL100. These ready made implants are designed with most of the important skills built in. This is the easiest way for a beginner to get hold of some implants but has the drawback that you cannot choose which skills you want to boost. 

·        Design and Build Implants

In the shops in AO it’s possible to buy empty implants and the separate skills clusters that need to be built into them. Basic implants can be found in the augmentation machines in general stores. The clusters can be found in the Trade department in the Shining Cluster, Bright Cluster and Faded Cluster machines.

Building implants this way can be a little cheaper than buying ready made implants and has the benefit of allowing you to choose exactly which skills you want to include in your implants. Building clusters into basic implants requires Nano Programming skill for most types of cluster. It’s also possible to ‘strip’ implants taking out the existing clusters leaving you with a basic implant. This process requires Break and Entry skill. 

On the whole, if you’re going to be designing and building your own implants you’ll get somebody else of a higher level to actually build them. Usually an MP is able to equip higher QLs of implants than he can build for himself. Still, for some temporary implants the MP is often able to build his own implants. There are several tools that can help you to design your implants such as Nano Nanny and Anti Guardians Implant Designer.


·        Loot Implants from Mobs

You’ll find quite a lot of blank and ready made implants as loot on mobs. Unfortunately, the ready made implants rarely have the skills built into them that you’ll need. It does happen sometimes though, so if you happen to come across an implant that has exactly the right skills for you, then it’s worth keeping hold of them. The blank implants can save you some money if you happen to find the right QLs for you.

On the whole, as a Rubika beginner, the ready made implants available in the basic shop will usually be the most important ones for you. Implants do cost quite a lot of money though, so you might want to look into some of the other options if you are very short on credits. 

If you begin life in Jobe as a Shadowlands MP, you will find that you can often loot Symbiants from the mobs in the training grounds. There are some of these symbiants which can be equipped by MPs. Symbiants are excellent implants that should be fairly easy to equip. Because of the way that symbiants are made, these ready made ‘implants’ will almost always have excellent skills and you should equip them wherever possible.

Symbiants can also be looted from special ‘pocket bosses’ which are spawned by players in the Shadowlands playfields from special blueprints. 

See the Basic Implant Choices section below for more information on implant design and symbiants.

First Shopping Lists

Below you’ll find two lists of items that you may want to acquire. One list is for level 5 MPs and the other for level 10 MPs. These lists are not exhaustive and do not take into account how much credits the items will cost. They are meant as guidelines only and you’ll need to go through the above mentioned process to make sure that you can actually use, afford or find the items in question.

If you’re short on cash you might wait until level 10 to buy some of the buffing nanos or Belt decks and NCU.

Section 4 – Getting the most out of your MP

The game of AO is based mainly around skills and statistics that a character can manage. Skills are seen easily in your skills window and are the most basic way in which you can manage your character. Statistics (like Armour Class or Nanocost Reduction or Nano Delta among many others) are usually improved by equipping items. Skills and statistics can be raised by various different means:

Allocating your IP in order to raise skills
Equipping Implants/Symbiants to raise skills and statistics
Equipping Armour and Items that raise skills and statistics
Investing in Perks that raise skills and statistics (Shadowlands Only)
Having ‘Buffs’ running in your NCU which raise your skills and statistics

This section will take you through the optimisation of an MP in order to cast the best possible attack pet. The same basic idea can be used for any purpose – equipping the best possible items, casting the best possible nanos, equipping the best possible armour etc. The only differences will be that you’ll use different skills and will need different buffs.
Step-by-Step Example of Attack Pet Optimisation

First, let’s take the example of trying to get the best possible attack pet that you can reach at your level. In this example, we’ll use a level 20 Nanomage MP in order to best show how to optimise your attack pet.

Attack Pets have casting requirements that use two skills:

·        Matter Creation (MatCre)
·        Time and Space (T&S)

In order to cast the very best pet possible, we will need to increase our MatCre and T&S skill as high as we possibly can. For the Level 20 Nanomage MP in our example, he can raise his MatCre and T&S to the following amounts using IP alone:

·        108 Matter Creation
·        108 Time and Space

That skill level would allow him to cast the QL17 “Inferior Fury Externalisation” attack pet. To have an attack pet that is lower in QL than your own level though would make you a very weak MP indeed. By the end of the optimisation process, our MP will be able to self-cast a QL33 attack pet – an attack pet almost twice as powerful as before! With the help of others, our MP can be more powerful still – reaching up to a QL40 attack pet that is twice his own level and the deepest of deep reds!

Adding in Buffs

In the shopping lists given in Section 3, we recommended buying the general nanos: “Matter Creation Expertise” and “Time and Space Expertise”. Expertises are buffs which you cast on yourself that will raise your skill by 20 points for as long as they are running in our NCU. Casting these on yourself will raise your MatCre and T&S skill levels to:

·        128 Matter Creation 
·        128 Time and Space

That skill level will allow you to cast a “QL24 Superior Fury Externalisation” attack pet. So by simply buffing ourselves with the relevant Expertise nanos we’ve improved the QL of our attack pet from 17 to 24, making the attack pet QL higher than our own level.

The MP is a profession that has its own special nanos which will buff the nanoskills still further. The lowest versions of these are called the Teachings which raise the nanoskills by 25 points each. For MatCre and T&S these are:

·          Teachings of Material Creation
·          Teachings of Time and Space
 
In order to cast both of these nanos, the MP will need 108 skill in both Psych Mod and Sense Imp nanoskills. Unfortunately, the level 20 Nanomage MP has only:

·        94 Psych Mod
·        94 Sense Imp

But remember the general Expertise nanos? They raise skills by 20 points each! By first casting the Psych Mod Expertise and Sense Imp Expertise nanos on himself, the MP can reach:

·        114 Psych Mod
·        114 Sense Imp

which will be enough to cast the Teachings of MatCre and T&S. By first buffing with the expertises, the MP is able to get his Psych Mod and Sense Imp high enough to then improve his MatCre and T&S still further by buffing with the Teachings. So the MP does the following:

1.      Cast MatCre and T&S Expertises
2.      Cast Psych Mod and Sense Imp Expertises
3.      Cast Teachings of MatCre 
4.      Cast Teachings of T&S

The Teachings work together with the Expertises – so their buffs add together. This is called “Stacking”. As long as you have enough NCU available, you’ll be able to have both Teachings (+25) and Expertise (+20) for MatCre running in your NCU at the same time adding up to give you +45 for that skill. So by using the above buffs, our level 20 Nanomage MP will have:

·        153 Matter Creation
·        153 Time and Space

This is enough skill to cast the “QL30 Supreme Fury Externalisation” attack pet. So by adding on the Expertise and Teachings buffs, our level 20 MP is now able to use a QL30 pet instead of a QL17 pet – a very big improvement.

Finally, we can add in some Ability Buffs. In the section on breeds, we explained that your Intelligence and other abilities add a little bit to other skills by “trickledown”. So by buffing the abilities we should be able to get a couple of extra skill points in order to cast the best possible pet. At level 20, the MP should be able to cast the general ability “Boost” nanos. The skills we want to increase are:

MatCre: Which is based on Intelligence and Stamina
T&S: which is based on Intelligence and Agility

So by casting the Intelligence Boost (+12 Int), Stamina Boost  (+12 Sta) and Agility Boost (+12 Agi) nanos on ourselves we can add a few more points to MatCre and T&S. These three will add +3 points to both MatCre and T&S allowing us to reach:

·        156 Matter Creation 
·        156 Time and Space

Stacking Buffs

Not all buffs will stack together. For example, there are two groups of General Nanos which buff the same skills:

·        The Proficiencies (+10 skill)
·        The Expertises (+20 skill)

If you buff yourself with a proficiency buff for a skill and then try to buff yourself with an Expertise for the same skill, the proficiency will be ‘overwritten’ by the Expertise. That means that the Proficiency buff will terminate and be replaced by the larger Expertise buff. 

If you buff yourself with an Expertise buff for a skill and then try to buff yourself with a Proficiency buff for the same skill, you will receive a message saying that a better buff is already running – and the proficiency will not be cast.

Similarly, there are several groups of MP-cast buffs for the nanoskills which do not ‘stack together’:

·        The Teachings (+25 skill)
·        The Masteries (+50 skill)
·        The Infuses (+90 skill)
·        The Mocham’s Gifts (+140 skill)

The MatCre Mastery will overwrite the MatCre Teaching. The MatCre Infuses will overwrite the MatCre Mastery and Teaching etc. 

But the MP-Cast nanoskills buffs will ‘stack’ together with a general buff for the same skill. This allows us to buff like the following examples:

·        MatCre Proficiency (+10) and MatCre Teaching (+25) = +35 MatCre
·        MatCre Expertise (+20) and MatCre Teaching (+25) = +45 MatCre

But we can never buff:

·        MatCre Proficiency and MatCre Expertise
·        MatCre Teaching and MatCre Mastery

In order to learn which groups of buffs will ‘stack’ together and which will not, it’s best to ask a friend or in the forums. You’ll also learn from experience which ones will go together and which will not.

Improving NCU to fit in the Buffs

By now, our level 20 Nanomage MP has the following buffs running in his NCU in order to reach 156 MatCre and T&S skill:

·        MatCre Expertise: 4 NCU req
·        T&S Expertise: 4 NCU req
·        Psych Mod Expertise: 4 NCU req
·        Sense Imp Expertise: 4 NCU req
·        MatCre Teaching: 7 NCU req
·        T&S Teaching: 7 NCU req
·        Intelligence Boost: 3 NCU req
·        Stamina Boost: 3 NCU req
·        Agility Boost: 3 NCU req

Total NCU Required for all these buffs = 39 NCU

Each player starts life with 8 NCU only, so in order to fit in all of these buffs at the same time, our Level 20 MP will have to upgrade his NCU. 

In Section 3, we included some basic information about extending NCU. You’ll need an NCU Belt Deck and some NCU Chips in order to do this. The Belt and Chips both have a Computer Literacy (Comp. Lit.) requirement in order to equip them. Our level 20 Nanomage MP has 108 Comp. Lit. if he has maxed it with IP. By adding a “Computer Literacy Expertise” buff, he can reach 128 Comp. Lit. This level of Comp Lit will allow him to equip:

·        Belt Component Platform 300X 

Which will give him 3 slots in which to equip NCU Chips. His 128 Comp Lit will allow him to equip 

·        QL50 16 - 31 NCU Memory chips

Which will give the MP 16 extra NCU per chip. Together, the Belt Deck and the 3 QL50 N CU Chips will add +48 NCU to the MP’s basic 8 NCU making a total of 56 NCU. This will be enough to fit in the buffs for the attack pet.

Adding in Implants

Implants are items that are equipped into your Implant slots. As long as the implant is equipped it will buff certain skills and statistics. Normal Implants from Rubi-Ka can buff 3 skills each in varying amounts. For the purposes of this section, we’ll be looking at the implants that you can buy from the Basic Shops in Rubi-Ka at special MP machines.

The MP Start-Up implants that will affect Matter Creation and Time and Space in order for us to cast a better attack pet are:

·        Head Implant: adds MatCre
·        Eye Impant: adds T&S
·        Right Hand: adds T&S

Implants have two requirements to equip them. Treatment and an ability which may vary according to the implant. The three pre-made implants we’ll need all have Intelligence as their ability requirement. You also need to use a Surgery Station in order to equip implants – you’ll find one in every general store. By right clicking on the Surgery Station you are enabled to change you implants and also receive a +100 Treatment buff.

We might start by buying the QL30 pre-made implants from the MP machine in the General Basic Store. The QL30 Head, Eye and Right Hand implants all have the following requirements to equip them:

·        Treatment: 148
·        Intelligence: 64

Our level 20 Nanomage MP has:

·        88 Treatment
·        75 Intelligence

So once he has right clicked on the Surgery Station and received his +100 Treatment buff, he’ll be easily able to equip the QL30 pre-made implants. That will add an extra:

·        +20 MatCre
·        +20 T&S

which along with the buffs we already added will bring our skills levels to:

·        176 MatCre
·        176 T&S

With this skill level our MP can now use the QL33 “Transcendent Fury Externalisation” attack pet. Now we have nearly doubled the QL of the attack pet we can use by including Buffs and Implants.


Adding in Shadowlands Perks

Our level 20 Nanomage MP also has the Shadowlands Expansion pack and is able to use Perks. By reaching level 20 he has earned 2 perk points which he can allocate to one of several different perk lines.

In order to improve his MatCre and T&S directly with his perks, the MP has two perk lines to choose from:

·        Channel Rage
·        Nano Doctorate

Unfortunately, at level 20 he only meets the requirements for adding a single perk point to Channel Rage. By doing so the MP raises MatCre and T&S by 3 points each. Along with the buffs and implants, that gives our MP

·        179 MatCre
·        179 T&S

Adding in External Buffs

Up until now, our optimisation has been based on the MP casting the pet all by himself. But Anarchy Online is a team game and the buffs that a player can cast on himself can often be cast on other players too. This means that by asking another player to buff him, our level 20 MP can increase his skills still further in order to cast an even better attack pet.

Apart from the general Proficiency and Expertise nanos, there are only two professions that can cast buffs which will directly increase the nanoskills: the MP and the Trader. Since our attack pet is cast using two nanoskills, we need MP or Trader buffs in order to be able to cast a better pet. Our MP has used 39 of the 56 NCU available to him – so he still has 17 NCU worth of room to ask others for buffs to help him.

Our level 20 MP might team with a Trader who can cast “Wrangles”. These are buffs that increase all of the nanoskills and also many weapon skills for a short period of time. He might ask the Trader to cast a “Skill Wrangler (Minor)” on him which would add 13 points to all of his nanoskills. This nano only has a 7 NCU cost and so our MP could fit it in quite easily. The extra 13 points would then bring our MP’s skills up to:

·        192 MatCre
·        192 T&S

This would enable our MP to cast a QL37 “Lesser Rage Materialization” attack pet – more than twice as powerful as the QL17 pet he could cast before optimisation began!

Or our level 20 MP might ask a higher level MP to buff him with the MatCre and T&S Masteries. Because the Masteries do not stack with the Teachings that our MP had already cast on him, they will ‘overwrite’ the Teachings. So the 14 NCU taken up by the teachings will be freed up giving our MP a total of 31 free NCU. Into this free NCU, the higher level MP that we asked to cast the masteries can now fit:

·        MatCre Mastery (+50 skill)
·        T&S Mastery (+50 skill)

So we lost the +25 from our teachings but gained instead +50 from the Masteries. That works out as an extra 25 points on our score giving us:

·        217 MatCre
·        217 T&S

which allows our level 20 MP to cast a QL40 “Inferior Rage Materialization” nano, giving him an extremely powerful pet with a QL twice that of his own level. He’s managed to do this by optimising his skills with buffs, implants, perks and buffs from friends.




Section 5 – Implants and Symbiants for Beginning MPs

You should build your implants in such a way as to increase the skills you need to increase. This will depend upon the choices that you make for your MP in terms of playing style, which tools and weapons you use and what level you are. At the very beginning as an MP you may well be best off using the pre-made implants available in the Basic Shops but most players soon want to make their own implants that fit their specific playstyles and items. 

This section gives you some basic information on the key design elements for MP implants. At the end of the section you’ll find some basic information on Symbiant Choices (Shadowlands Implants).

Important skills to implant

For an MP the most important skills are the Nanoskills and the nano-casting related skills like NanoC-Init. Look at the nanos that you want to be able to cast next, see how much skill you need to cast them and then implant in order to be able to reach those skills where possible. Also, because the MP has expensive Body Development skills and many MPs have very low hitpoints, the Max Health implants are very useful as they increase your hitpoints considerably.

To get an overview of the priorities in terms of which skills it's most important to implant - read through the sections in this guide about IP Distribution. In the sections on IP Distribution, you'll find information that helps you to choose which skills to raise - both with IP and with implants. 

Tools and Utilities to help you design your implants

In the Resources section of this guide, you’ll find links to some utilities that may help you to mess around with different implant setups and see which ones give you the right skills. Nano Nanny, The AntiGuardians Implant Design Tool and Rustot's Skills emulator are all good tools for that purpose. They allow you to choose the skills and the QLs and see what QL of implant you need and which clusters will give you the skills you're looking for. 

Basic Skills to Implant

The basic set-up for an MP is usually around the attack and heal pets. The attack pets need Time&Space (TS) and Mat Cre (MC). The heal pets need TS and Bio Met (BM). 

Second priority is usually the Mez pets and the nukes. The Mez pets need TS and Mat Met (MM). and the nukes need Psych Mod (PM) and MC. 

·        Top priority would be: TS - MC - BM 
·        Second priority would be: PM and MM 

There is one exception to this general rule: The MP has very good nanoskills buffs which use PM and SI. Sometimes, it will work out better for you overall to prioritise PM and SI in your implants so that you can reach the next highest nanoskills buffs. That enables you to buff all of your nanoskills much higher. 

So, if implanting with PM and SI in priority will gain you better nanoskills buffs - then that is often the best thing to do. Otherwise implant with priority on TS - MC -BM. 

How does Prioritisation affect implant design?

The biggest deciding factor for prioritisation is the Shining Head Cluster slot. All 6 of the nanoskills use the Shining Head slot - and only one cluster may go in there. Shining clusters also give the biggest skills buff - equal to bright and faded put together. So the very top priority skill tends to go in there. 

The other clusters - Bright and Faded for each skill - also clash for some skills. You use your priorities to decide which cluster should win. 

One other major element of any implant set for an MP is the Max Health implant. MPs tend to have weak Hitpoints - so implanting for those can be very important. 



Basic Implant Designs

The following layouts will give you the key skills for an MP. Fill the other empty slots according to your own personal choices and desires.

Symbiant Choices for the Shadowlands MP 

With Shadowlands, it is possible to acquire and equip Symbiants. These are essentially implants that are ready built but unlike normal Rubika implants, they include many skills that would normally clash. Essentially, all MP Symbiants include Shining, Bright and Faded ‘clusters’ for all 6 nanoskills, treatment, comp lit and nanopool benefits - and then add on to that basis many other skills, abilities and stat bonuses. 

As a result of the very impressive skills buffs these Symbiants give, these are very sought after and can be looted from mobs in the Jobe backyard and from pocket bosses created by players using blueprints in Shadowlands.

There are three basic types of Symbiant for the MP:

·        Extermination Unit Aban

This type is the most basic type and buffs the fewest skills beyond nanoskills and treatment. 

Above Treatment, Profession and Level requirements, Extermination Unit Symbiants are based on Intelligence and Psychic requirements plus one other ability based on the implant.

Extermination Symbiants have a mix of defensive and offensive skills and include basic Pistol and Flingshot skill buffs for weaponry.

·        Support Unit Aban

This type is the second best and buffs a lot of skills. 

Above Treatment, Profession and Level requirements, Support Unit Symbiants are based on Agility and Sense requirements plus one other ability based on the implant. 

Support Unit symbiants include strong defensive skills with extensive AC, Heal Delta, Add All Def, parry and riposte skills buffs. They also add a few tradeskills and ability buffs on top. Offensively, these symbiants offer some Phys Init, Bow and Martial Arts buffs.

·        Control Unit Aban

This type includes the most skills buffs for the MP. 

Above Treatment, Profession and Level requirements, Control Unit Symbiants are based on Intelligence and Psychic requirements plus one other ability based on the implant.

Control Unit symbiants include good defensive skills with Evades (instead of AC), Add All Def, Heal Delta but are strongly focussed on Tradeskills, offering a wide range of tradeskill buffs. Offensively, the Control Unit symbiants are focussed on Pistol and Flingshot.

At lower levels, any symbiant that can be equipped by the MP is likely to be better overall than a normal Rubika implant. The Support Unit symbiants are perhaps more targeted at Opifex MPs with their Agi and Sense requirements. Control and Extermination Unit symbiants probably lend themselves best to Nanomage MPs. Solitus MPs should be able to equip any type of Symbiant well.

Atrox MPs will tend to struggle with the ability requirements on all MP symbiants. Still, with the benefit of no clashing clusters – particularly in the shining head slot – an Atrox MP should be able to gain more from symbiants than from Rubika implants even at the lower QLs he can equip.

For a detailed listing of the skills buffed by each type of symbiant for the MP, please refer to the “Advanced Implant Choices” section of this guide.

Section 5 – Basic Guide to Pet Control and Scripts


As we covered in the early sections of this guide, the attack pet can be controlled through the command line (ie hit enter, type in the command), through the Pet Window buttons and from the shortcut bar using macro icons. This Section will take you through the control of several pets at once (the MP can have three different types of pet at the same time) and will teach you the basics about creating scripts.

Macros 

You can either have the game help you with this or do them yourself. The command "/macro" creates a little icon for your to place on your shortcut bar (press "Y" if you can't see that). Which then allows you to perform the command just by pressing a number from 1 - 0 depending on it's position on the bar. 

You'll soon see what I mean after you've tried it if that didn't make sense. 

If you want the game to help you simply type in "/help pet" and click on each of the links to create the macro stuck to your cursor. Also, for some commands you can drag icons off the Actions => Pets menu. 

If you'd like to create your own then each of the following typed into the command line will create an icon for you

·        /macro Attack /pet attack 

·        /macro Report /pet report 

·        /macro Wait /pet wait 

·        /macro Follow /pet follow 

·        /macro Behind /pet behind 

·        /macro Hunt /pet hunt 

·        /macro Rename /pet "<petname after casting>" rename "<intended name>"

·        /macro Heal /pet heal 


With regard to the command "/pet hunt" - Pet hunt uses an algorithm that chooses the next target by shortest line distance. This means it has a tendency to choose targets in a fairly unpredictable fashion. That is it won't follow a logical room to room path if a mob in another room is closer even if it has to run through 4 rooms to get to the "closer" mob. Its highly recommended that you use this command with extreme caution.


Naming Pets 

When using pet commands you can make them apply to a specific pet by naming the pet in the command. This section is important the moment you have to start controlling more than one pet. 

Just a quick couple of notes on pet names: 


·        They must be at least 4 characters long. 

·        If you have a space in the name you must enclose the name in quotation marks ("name here"). 

·        According to the terms you agree to play the game you cannot name the pet to the same name as an NPC character or static mob.

·        According to the terms you agree to play the game you cannot use rude, insulting or inflammatory names.


Unless you name the pet correctly then you will receive some odd responses from the pets. If you use "/pet attack" when you have a heal pet, then the heal pet will tell you it cannot attack. If you use "/pet heal" when you have an attack pet or mez pet, then they will tell you that is beyond their ability. 

Also, if you have an attack pet and a mez pet at the same time, they will both respond to the "/pet attack" command and usually you want the attack pet to attack one target and the mez pet to attack another target - so you'll have to give each pet a command by name in order to control them properly. 

To rename a pet, either target the pet you wish to rename and type: 

·        /pet rename "My pet Name Here" 

Or take a look at the name above the pet after you cast it and use the following: 

·        /pet "<name over head>" rename "<new name>" 

Notice in particular the quotation marks (“) at the beginning and end of the names. Pets with a single word as a name don't need these quotation marks included. Pets with spaces, colours or more than one word in their name may need to be put in quotation marks. As a rule, it's a good idea to just always use the ""s to be on the safe side. 

Using Pet Names in commands

All pet commands you use take the form: 

·        /pet "<pet name>" <command> 

eg /pet "Mighty Meatball" Attack 

or /pet "Ralph the healer" Heal 

These types of macro's work particularly well in conjunction with rename macros, otherwise the macro would have to be updated every time the pets name changed. 

Finally, if you use colourful names then the command must reflect that or it won't work. For more information about adding colours to names, please refer to the Advanced Scripting section later in this guide


Scripts, Variables & Chat Commands 

Scripts are text files that sit in a Scripts folder inside of the Anarchy Online program folder. They are test files that include a series of commands – one on each line of the text file. When the script is run, each of the commands in the script file will be given in order. It’s a useful way of automating certain series of commands that you use often.

Naming and running Script Files

Scripts do not require any extension (the last part of the file name, like .txt) and will usually work with and without. If you include the .txt extension then you must remember to include that extension when you try to run the script. So:

To run the script named “attack” type in the text window

/attack

To run the script named “attack.txt” type in the text window

/attack.txt

On the whole it's best to pick one naming convention for your scripts and stick to it. 

Keep in mind that Windows XP often hides the extensions on filenames for you – so even if it doesn’t look like there’s an extension, the extension may be there in reality. If your script doesn’t run when you try it, try running the script including the .txt extension as above.

Scripts can also be added to the Shortcut bar, by using the same Macro technique: 

·        /macro ButtonName /scriptfilename 

These files are basically command lists and are fairly versatile. 


Script Commands and Variables

The following script has no real purpose, but should provide enough of an example for script creation. 

Filename: Attack 
 
/s Eek! Look out there's a nasty %t! 
 
/pet chat "Fear not master I shall kill it for you!" 
 
/delay 5000 
 
/v Well go on then… kill it!
 
/pet chat "Which one was it again?" 
 
/v D’oh… the %t!
 
/pet "Mighty Meatball" attack 
 
/me sighs 

This script would be run by entering it as a command into AO (ie "/Attack") which would then run through the commands one at a time. Try it and see what happens. J

Variables are useful things that allow us to name things in chat or commands without typing the full name. 

·        %t is replaced with the name of your target 

·        %m is replaced by your own name 

One very useful script command is /selectself. This command will make you the selected target. It's particularly useful for a common script: 

/selectself 
 
/delay 150 
 
/pet "Healpet Name" heal 

which will select you and tell the heal pet to heal you. 

You'll have noticed the /delay command in the scripts above. Sometimes, if you have a particularly fast computer the scripts will miss a command in a script because it was 'typed in' too fast. By using /delay XXX where XXX is the desired delay time in milliseconds, you can get around this problem. 

On the whole though, you want to make your commands happen as fast as possible, so only use these /delays if you are having a problem with a script and experiment with it to find the lowest working /delay time to use.
