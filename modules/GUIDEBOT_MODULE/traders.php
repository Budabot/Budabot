<font color = yellow>At a glance</font>
<font color = red>* Main Weapons: Shotgun</font>
* Alternate Weapons: Pistol
* Main Nanoskills: PM/TS for Drains and Wrangles, SI for Calms, BM for Heals.
* Tradeskills: Good
* Overall Difficulty: Hard
Traders are merchants who also happen to be quite good at shotguns, for some reason.  They have access to the special Trader shop, and have several key Trader-only items.  Their drains allow them to cast nanos and use weapons far above their normal ability, while their wrangles are one of the most sought after buffs in the game. They are one of the classes that excel at tradeskills, and even have several powerful tradeskill buffs. They even have decent heals and calms, to boot.

<font color = yellow>Race</font>
<font color = red>Most races can do well as a Trader.</font>  Atrox traders will suffer in terms of nanoskills in later levels, due to less trickledown from abilities, but they have a great HP bonus which helps in early level PvP.  Nanomage traders are a bit squishy, but later on they will have higher nanoskills and can equip most of the Trader-only stuff earlier.  Solitus and Opifex both are pretty average choices for Traders, with no strong weaknesses or strengths.

<font color = yellow>Abilities</font>
<font color = red>* Strength - The only reason to keep this ability maintained is because it is the base stat for Shotgun.  I'd put points into here, as long as you can afford it.
* Agility - Important, but not crucial. I would max this stat out early on, as a lot of implants are Agility-based.  As you level up, you can put less points into it.
* Stamina - Important, but not crucial.
* Intelligence - Max this out. Important for nanoskills and trader equipment.
* Sense - Important, but not crucial.
* Psychic - Max this out. Important for nanoskills and trader equipment.</font>

<font color = yellow>Weapon Skills</font>
<font color = red>The preferred weapon skill is Shotgun.</font>  Traders, however, are able to equip a variety of weapons by virtue of their drains.  Still, it is probably best, from an IP expenditure standpoint, to go with Shotgun.

<font color = yellow>Speed</font>
<font color = red>Ranged Init</font> - Go for it. Going the way you're going, you'll soon equip scopes that will lower this skill, and it's generally a skill worth upping.
Nano C Init - Yeah, put some IPs into this one as well. When you're well up some levels, you can put in a Nanoformula Recompiler that will add lots to this as well - so that should help.
Evades, Duck explosives - These skills work great on a well played trader. Ladder some good drains on the mobs and they won't hit you as much, wich helps immensly. This should be effective in pvm up to and through title level 2.

<font color = yellow>Trade & Repair :</font>
<font color = red>Comp Lit</font> - Max this one.
Anything else? No, if you made a trader to do tradeskills, it's better to be patient and wait until you hit title cap around level 130 or so before putting many of these skills up. You may want to put some up, but IP soon gets scarce, and I recommend you save what you can.

<font color = yellow>Nano & Aiding</font>
<font color = red>Don't put up matter creation and matter metamorphosis.</font>
For now, those two skills are more worth in the ways of IP you can save on not putting them up.
You can put those up later in your career.
You may want to max the other nano skills, especially time & space and psychological modifications.
These two skills are used for roots, drains, wrangles, the nanos that shorten down roots and
probably something else not mentioned. Psychological modifications is also used in calms and (*gross*) charms.
Charms will kill you, but calms are good. Biological metamorphosis is for heals.
Sensory impression is for calms, charms and our yummy Comp Lit buffs.

<font color = yellow>Spying & Navigation</font>
<font color = red>If anything, put some in perception for PVP and perhaps some help on the scopes.</font>
Map Navigation can be imped, but enough to get the most basic map reader upgrades won't
exactly hurt you much. Break and Entry should be *at least* your level if you want a chance at opening chests
later on. If you don't want to open chests and doors, forget it. You can open them later in your career.
By now, you've no tradeskill use for the skill anyways.


As you go up, IP gets tighter. It's up to you to find out what to prioritise.
I, myself, tried a somewhat risky approach and only put up time & space and psychological modifications
and a little bit sensory impression up until level 70-80 where I had a bit more IP and got'em maxed.

The reason was I wanted to PVP, and I thought I could be better at it if I spent my IP on
other stuff than calms and health drains. Healing in teams could be done by others and in pvp,
opponents would be dead before I relied on health drains anyways.
I also left the calming on those levels up to others ..

It worked and IP never got really tight for me because when I started PVMing more,
I got spare IPs to put on the other skills anyways. I doubt my way is something one
would generally recommend, but it shows how you can think out your own strategy.

<font color = yellow>Weapon Recommendations</font>
When you're about to pick your shotgun, I recommend picking one of these :
* Vektor ND Shotgun / Home Defender - ql 50 / 180 / ql 50 / 200
These shotguns have no specials at all. On the bright side, you don't have to put any special skills to use them, and that can save you some IP on the lower to mid levels. Also, on the bright side, twinking these babies on with drains and getting a wrangle from your fellow trader makes'em easy to equip on high QLs. Also, they're very easy to get a hold of and can be found in shop terminals. I think I'd pick Vektor over home defender as it hits for energy damage instead of the home defender's projectile. The way people put up duck explosives, they'll crit in pvp as well.

* OT-Windchaser SM30s Shotguns - ql 50 / 190
Another shotgun with no specials, these are easy to get a hold of and, as far as I know, go from ql 1 to 190. Another okay choice for the lowbie trader with an IP problem, these will be easy to get on at high QLs. They are very fast and crit reliant, so regular damage won't be too good, but high AR and a lowbie crit scope along with it's fast attack and recharge should get those crits going. They sell in shops and can be rolled from missions.

* Pump Trainee / Pump Master - ql 40 / 50
Awesome gun. If you can get a hold of one, enjoy it while you can because as they only go from QL 40 (trainees) up to 50 (master), you'll outgrow it in no-time. It is a *very* good Shotgun, grossly overpowering those who use it most traders would say. Drops from dynabosses.

* Ithaca - ql 50 / 199
This is an old PVP favourite. Truth is, being crit reliant as it is, it's best to wait with these until you can get on at least a ql 250 Vision Enhancer, granting you 8% crit chance. Also, having two specials, it can get a bit on the expensive side, IP-wise, on lower through mid levels. Also, having two specials, you'll probably end up wielding it on far lower QL than a home defender or Vektor. So if you're lower level, I recommend you leave this one in the freezer for now.

* Maw of the Abyss - ql 1 (only)
This gun drops in IS, second floor and aside from the looks, I quite like it. With the arrival of SL, the min damage ain't bad at all and so it's definetly nice to have if you haven't gotten yourself a Mudurlugu or perhaps some high QL shattergun dual wield combo. On RK, I daresay an ithaca with Mark of Peril, Take The Shot and an 8% VE scope will outdamage Maw, but then again you can't beg for outsides all the time (or can you?) and the higher min damage is definetly welcome in SL. There are some drawbacks. It's largely useless in PVP and the Fling Shot requirement is rather insane. Unless you implant Fling Shot some, this gun can be a bit tiresome to equip at lower levels ..

<font color = yellow>Trader Role </font>
<font color = red>A little bit of what you can expect during your career.
* Wrangler:
In the daily life, outside the battlefields, traders are wranglers.
The wrangle lines trader's get are often immensly helpful to other players and
we get asked for them a lot. If you don't yet know what wrangles are, check the 'Guide to Wrangles'.

Handing out wrangles is often a major stress factor to higher level traders,
and common frustrations include :

 * Wrangled player hasn't got the buffs needed prior to wrangle.
 * Wrangled player notices he/she didn't have enough NCU.
 * Wrangled player didn't realise wrangles don't put up specials.
 * Wrangled player gets surprised when 3 minutes over, he/she is OEd.
 * Trader has to travel to someplace with mobs to wrangle one person
 * Trader can't find person to wrangle because he/she disappears when trader drains
 * Trader wrangles one after another using plenty of time because would-be-wrangled don't accept or ask for team invite.
 * Trader gets asked for wrangles by players who just want to 'see how high their skills will go'.
</font>
( Taken from the 'Guide to Wrangles' )

When people are looking for a trader, they sometimes try the /list approach.
/list is a command wich you can use to get a list of players in the playfield
with different variables you can specify. '/list trader' will give a list of the traders in the zone.

Being a wrangler, you don't want people asking you for wrangles wherever you may be.

In order not to be look up in this way, just type '/anon'.

You are now marked as anonymous and won't pop up on /list search.
As many other traders have said, '/anon is your friend'.

I prefer to go outside SG and announce I'm handing out wrangles if I feel like being nice,
and it happens every now and then. That way, I can help people when I have time for it.

Tradeskillers :

Yes, we have a knack for tradeskills and you'll probably find people who will want you to make something or need you for a tradeskill buff. In many ways, we are beaten by the engineer profession when it comes to high QL tradeskilling, but on the other hand, we are the ones with the buffs.

If you want to become a tradeskiller, I advise you to be patient and wait until you are well into TL 4 on your way to TL5 when IP gets more plenty. Focusing a character on tradeskilling from the start is an easy way to cripple your character. Neither are tradeskills in much demand at lower levels, and when they are, low level players usually seek out high level players to do the stuff anyways.

Trader's Team role on RK :

Damage Dealers :

On the lower levels (100 and below), you can be an excellent damage dealer. On these levels, a trader's capacity for twinking is quite awesome. It is important to have as much hit points as possible, because using a shotgun, your crits will steal aggro.

Of course, it is dependent on choice of weapon and so on as well, especially later in your career.

In the higher levels, we still do quite alright if you can get the good trader weapons. Mostly, we are outclassed by MAs, shades, soldiers, enfs etc. but seeing we're a support class, I suppose that's the way it should be.


Calmer/Healer/Mezzer :

Anyways, the role you'll fill in a team will be diverse, but primarily calmer. Trader calms are excellent calms and, if my sources are right, only exceeded by crat calms. Besides, having drains, we reach our higher calms faster than other professions.

The calms are sometimes far between in QL, though. Nevertheless, the calmer role is a fun role to play in my opinion, and calms are great when soloing mobs as well.

We can also be backup healers and we even get roots. Also, on higher levels, you'll probably want to raise skills to get those AC drains going. Lots of nanos to play with, and they are very, very handy when soloing. Thus a high nanopool is nice, even if we do get stackable nano drains to keep the juice flowing.

Players who use nanos made to 'mess up' (or mesmerize) the mobs like roots, calms, ac drains and so on are commonly referred to as a mezzer. That will be you.

Buffer? :

We get team wrangles. Some people like the trader to keep these team wrangles coming. While this buffs attack/nano skills for your team mates, unless you're handing out small wrangles considering your capabilities, it will cripple your ability to do just about everything else. So, if they don't need your abilities to do anything else, sure, you can wrangle them. Generally, most prefer not to .. And if needed, having to get drains up after each wrangle run out sucks.

Regarding your highest team wrangles, this 'job' is best done when your nano skills are so high or when you're buffed so that you can refresh your top drains while still doing team wrangles ..

Keeping 132 wrangles coming at level 120 f.ex really, really sucks.

Check with the other players in the team to check wether your wrangles can help. Sometimes, a doc might only be a few nanoskills away from a better heal f.ex. Then you might be able to help out without setting yourself back too much.

Laddering/Using Drains

You got your trader up and going. Now it's time to check out what you can do with him/her. The trader's strength lies primarily in his/her drains. There are two lines of drains for you once you're up and about, namely 'Ransack Skills' and 'Deprive Skills'. These come in different QLs, some better than the others.

This is how to put them to use :

When you cast deprive skills on a leet, it's attack skills and nano skills will decrease. ( Well, in theory. It doesn't *really* have much effect on them. ) Your attack skills and nano skills, however, will go up. If you then cast ransack skills on the same leet, it will stack with the deprive skills, thus lowering the leet's skills even further and your skills even higher. Now that your skills have been temporarily upped, you may be able to cast a better version of deprive skills, which puts them up further. Then you may be able to cast a better ransack.

Deprive is easier to land than ransack, so starting your laddering with it is preferable.

It goes on like this until you're at the best drain you can cast. Your attack skills and nano skills will be upped considerably, so you'll do more damage, crit more often, be able to equip better guns, throw nastier nanos and so on while the duration lasts. Note that specials, like fling shot, do not increase by draining mobs.

When doing missions, etc. this optimal state of performance is where traders prefer to 'work'. when one is at one's highest drains, just make sure to recast your highest ransack/deprive before they time out.

Keep track of the skills you have when fully drained. Also keep an eye on the drains you just can't use yet and get get them when you can. When you have a new drain run, recheck your skills to see if you can run an even better drain than before. Drain, check, upload nano and repeat if possible and you'll be uber in no-time.


Using drains to equip 'stuff' :

- Better Shotgun

This is really simple, and you'll probably figure it out on your own.
Get a shotgun expertise, get your top drains going, note down your shotgun skill.
Then check how much above your drained shotgun skill you can go before you are Over Equipped.
This is easily done by doing a '/tell helpbot OE #' (# is your skill). Then check what QL shotgun you can use and
not be OEd while at fully drained. To equip the shotgun, run expertise, find a trader that can give you the wrangle
you need, then run and drain something and equip it. Now, you'll probably be OEd, but as soon as your drains hit the
roof, you'll be under the 20% curse.

Some prefer a bit lower QL guns in PVP, wich
may be smart sometimes, considering what might happen.



- Better NCU upgrades

You can also use this method to get on NCU. Get a decent amount of NCU. When draining up, hitting the +55 comp lit
buff doesn't take long. If you can afford it, get some comp lit or Psymod/senseimp assist imps in as well.
What you want is to get enough NCU to do something like this :

Sensory impression expertise + teachings (+25)/masteries(+50)/infuses(+90)/mochams(+140) +
Psychological Modifications expertise + teachings (+25)/masteries(+50)/infuses(+90)/mochams(+140) +
Biggest possible wrangle (up to 131 or 132) from a fellow trader +
your own drains.

( teachings, masteries, infuses and mochams are all Meta Phycisist buffs to nanoskills.
They do not stack with eachother, but get the biggest you can get for this to work )

This ought to get your nano skills up by a lot.
Probably enough to run some nifty comp lit buffs, namely :
Frequent Customer (+55), Bulk Trader (+160) and Trading Mogul (+260)

Having run the highest possible of these, start swapping out your old NCU stuff with new upgrades.
If you don't have enough NCU to do this process, do what you can so you get more NCUs to repeat.
Along with more NCUs, you might want a 'Nano Formula Recompiler' at as high QL as possible to get those
drains flying. You'll feel like a whole new trader afterwards .. 

Trader Shops :

You can't use these until you hit level 25. If you haven't seen'em already,
and you don't want to spoil the surprise (or disappointment), skip this bit.

The trader shop terminal can be found inside special shops.

Trader terminals mostly contain profession specific stuff for other professions.
Most of it is rubbish, but sometimes you might run into someone who want their hands on a BBI.
The only use we have for them is that selling stuff in the trader shop terminal gives considerable
better price for the items than in the other terminals. If you're desperate for cash,
grab what loot you can and head over to one.

Also, getting your comp lit up by buffing yourself will also raise the amount of money you get.
This works on all shop terminals.

After checking today with various items, a miiitar, a mentor's strawhat and a flowers tech helmet,
I can happily announce the increase in money gained from selling things in the trader shop
instead of regular shops is at an impressive 75%.

Note that some other shops and vendors also have an increase in money from sales,
but none as high as the trader terminal.

Drainpets :

You might be challenging a Desert Eremite, marching to a tower battle or getting ready for a pvp bash in MMD.

If you can, always drain up before you start fighting!

This is usually done by finding some low level mob, draining it and then calming it, keeping it as a 'pet'.
These 'drainpets' are often used in pvm or to keep your skills up in tower battle, etc. as well if there's nothing else
to drain. You may have seen traders draining the ICC guards in Meetmedere as well or pulling rollerrats and whatnot
with them when they're marching out to war.

So, the idea is simple. Drain the mob, pull it where you want it, calm for later use.
You can head back to this pet once in a while when you need to recast your drains.


Using calms and Nano drains in fight :

I feel a bit silly writing this as you'll figure a lot of this out on your own.

When you're up against a tough mob, see if you can get your drains in, then calm it.
Replenish your health/nano, and now you can start fighting the mob again at your optimal performance.
You'll have the nanopool to heal yourself, root, etc.
If things start looking grim, just calm it again & replenish .. Simple as that!

Of course, keeping a drainpet handy can also be good if mob counter your drains.

Also, after draining up, you can cast nano drains on the mob you're fighting.
These nanos stack even when thrown on the same mob and even works if said mob f.ex dies.
Spam a few of those and you'll have nano to keep yourself alive.
Maybe you won't have to calm after all.


Using calms in teams :

Being a calmer takes a bit work, but can be very fun. When you're in a mission,
watch out for the doorways. Try and move around a bit to get a good look.
There might be a mob in there just waiting to aggro. If you see one, target and calm.

When fighting, always position yourself where you get the best view of the situation
and any directions from wich potential adds might come and attack the team.

Also keep a lookout for engineers, MPs and Crat mobs as their pets are sure to turn up.
Also keep a lookout on your own calmed mobs. People like to attack calmed mobs,
and pets sometimes also like to try and mess up your job.

If there are noone on the team who really wants an AS, you can also calm ahead.
Basically, that means taking a couple of minutes to calm the mobs in the coming areas
so that the team get an easier time pulling one at a time instead of the first three.
It's especially nice taking the lift up to a pre-calmed boss room.

There are problems with ASing calmed mobs, though, so some agents might get a little whiny.
Sometimes, some team members may think you're about to do something completely
different and follow you, so it's best to tell them what your calming plans are ..


Using charms :

The charmline seems more than a little borked.

When you try charming something, you'll get rooted and unable to cast nanos or fight - even if it doesn't land!
Aside from that little problem, our charms have long duartions and stuff, so if the root wasn't there....

There's no way to get aorund the root easily, but there is a way at least.
With each hit you take from a mob, there's a slight percentage you'll get smacked out of the root.

So what you need is to get smacked a lot. Try and do something like this ..

Before you charm, get aggro from lower level mobs, drain them and head for what you wanna charm.
Charm the mob while you still have aggro from the lowbie and the lowbie mobs hitting you might snap
you out of charm eventually.


I've been trying this against Elysium hecklers where it seems to work quite well.
I got aggro from a group of mobs from the unredeemed temple north of port 7,
headed south to heckler land and tried to calm horrors ..

On 3 attempts, the charm landed 3 times. My nanoskills must've been about 1150-1200 or so.

Suppose I'll try Scheol hecklers next ..


Wrangling Tips
How many times have you heard people ask you for the 'highest wrangle' or a '132', even when you know people would do good with a 74?

A good tips for those who get caught wandering in public is to drain up, then cast a 131 wrangle on yourself. Now you'll get both the debuff and the buff. That amounts to a loss in nanoskills at 11 .. Enough so that most traders through TL4 to TL5 and up should be able to recast 131 wrangles as long as they still have their drains going. So until then, just keep handing out those 131s. The debuffs won't stack with the one you have going from wrangling yourself. ";
