(blue)-= Organization Departments =-

(white) Hello all!

 A meeting was held with the generals and Unit commanders to set some policies for the org, and to establish some roles within the org.
 It was decided to establish an atttendance policy of sorts. If a person does not log in to Anarchy for 30 days, they will be removed from the org. Alts do count, but just please let someone know that you are online. This is to make sure that the org does not have players in it that nobody has seen for a long time. if you cannot be online for whatever reason for an extended period of time, just let a general know.
