Omni Camps (vs Clan Quests)

Guide suited for: All Classes
Faction: Neutral, Omni
Level Range: 210-220

**Work in progress **

With the release of the 17.2 patch, various new NPCs have appeared. 
One with a nice story to tell is one Paolo Turin, found near the Grid terminal in the Omni-1 Trade District: 

He tells us about various rumours within Omni territory, regarding the clans building up special forces within training camps of theirs. 
As Paolo knows, there is a Sergeant Jasmine Cordell who is looking for volunteers to help fight this new threat to the corporation. 
So, as every good employee is supposed to, we'll head straight to her to see wether we can lend a hand too! 
Her location isn't a big secret, as Paolo directs us to seek her in the area between the two Whompah stations in the Omni-1 Entertainment District. 
And this is where we find her, nearby the Veteran Point vendor terminal: 


Besides giving us more detailed information about the five new camps, she also hands out missions to take those on. 
Each of these missions requires us to first kill five of the adds, and then the main boss. 
After achieving that, on return to the Sergeant, she awards a Military Reward insignia. 
This item, besides being shiny white,Military Reward Insignia
It has nice use: Upon right clicking it, it increases the owner's side tokens by 50, and the victory points by 500. 


The mission bosses, as well as their adds (with a very low droprate) may drop any of the following items, as well as OFAB weapon- and armour improvement biomatter clumps:

<font color = yellow>The Camps </font>

The new camps themselves provide for an interesting new raiding experience. 
Besides most of them requiring a team of 210+ characters, they also require unique strategies to effectively take them out. 

<font color = red>Brigadier Crux</font> located in Belial Forest.

Hardly worth calling a camp, the Brigadier took residence in a few ruins bordered to the north by a lake, to the south by a mountain range and small water flows with bridges across them to the east and west. 
It is patrolled by Clan Panthers, which are level 250 Martial Artists hitting for melee damage. 

The first part of the mission to take on the Brigadier's camp is to kill five of these to prepare for your main assault. 

After getting them out of the way for a few minutes, it is strongly suggested to not head straight for the Brigadier, but instead to take out his three named sidekicks first.
Corporal Bakken, Doctor Ellingsen and Sergeant Billowitz. 

The Corporal is a Nanotechnician, who somehow manages to score regular hits even though he has a Cyberdeck equipped. His main attack though is Kel's Neutronium Plaything, an AoE nuke that can do up to 3000 points of damage. 
The Doctor's main attribute seems to be his restorative capability, including a resistance to the One Foot In The Grave Soldier nano line. 
The Sergeant does not seem to have any particular special tricks up his sleeve. Once those three are disposed of, they should not make a comeback for quite a while, typically far longer than a fight with the Brigadier will last. 
If they are not taken out beforehand, Crux will call them to his aid once he suffers some damage. 


Brigadier Crux himself is an Enforcer, wielding a quite big hammer. He does not move from his spawnpoint, and tends to warp people who angered him sufficiently up into the sky above him. 
Apart from this extremely annoying specialty, his melee hits seem to proc a 30 m AoE stun called Stunning Blow, which can result in quite long chainstunning of a designated tank and his unfortunate team members in the vicinity. 
Ranged damage dealers and healers should definitely keep their distance, if possible. The stun itself is breakable with Free Movement stims. 
So keeping a stack of these on the hotbar can allow for a quick escape from a situation that might mean death otherwise.
