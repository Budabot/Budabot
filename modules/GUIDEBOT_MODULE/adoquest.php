Adonis quests - the rise and fall of Xan super civilization 

Note: This quest line might be challenging even for some end-game characters, so doing it in team is advised.

You can pick up this quest line right after zoning into Adonis, like so most of the quests from lower Shadowlands zones. First thing you'll notice, is namely Yutto by name <font color='#FF9900'>One Who Points the Way</font><font color='#33FF33'>. He's right by the portal from Shoel to Adonis.</font>
  
<font color = yellow>2)</font><font color='#33FF33'> The quest has numerous steps to it, and there are spots you can 'pause' the quest at to continue on.</font>
  
  <font color = yellow>Step 1:</font><font color='#FF9900'> One Who Greets Wanderers</font>.
  Just inside the building North from the One Who Points the Way.
  He'll task you to kill 3 Stingers, found in the underwater area just north of his location.You'll get Fish Treats when that is complete.
  Turn that into him and he'll reward you with <font color='#33FF33'>Insignia of Gilthar</font> and <font color='#33FF33'>Insignia of Dalja.</font>
  
  <font color = yellow>Step 2:</font><font color='#FF9900'> Foruth Watch Down</font>
  His problem are spirits, but for now, just finding them is enough. You'll have to tab <font color='#33FF33'>Cascading, Voluminous, Slinking and Magnanimous Spirit.</font>
  Once completed, return to him and he'll reward you with <img src=rdb://136332><a href='itemref://226266/226266/1'>Kanel's Story - First Edition (Spec 3/1)</a>
  
  
  <font color = yellow>Step 3:</font><font color='#FF9900'>This one is dependant upon your side, Clan or Omni</font>
  <font color='#33FF33'>Clan</font>
  <font color='#FF9900'>Conserver Gil Cama-Hume</font>
	If this is your first time to Adonis, reaching him will pose a bit of problem, since he stands on top of a cliff.
	Trick is to jump into water north of Outmost Yard, swim NE and then climb up the hill south.
	Uncharacteristic for Redeem, he comes right out and ask you to butcher the opposition.
	You'll need to kill 5 <font color='#FF9900'>Baran-Kaars</font> and <font color='#FF9900'>5 Cimi-Els</font>
	(Located at the Unredeemed Village just south of Piercing Tundra in Western Adonis).

	Next, you need to kill <font color='#FF9900'>Biran-Keir the Custodian</font>, located in a dungeon.
	You will get a mission key and update once completing the previous kills to guide you there. To get there, just follow your directional arrow.

	Once dead, claim your reward - <img src=rdb://37932><a href='itemref://226267/226267/1'>Kanel's Story - Second Edition (Spec 3/2)</a> from Conserver Gil Gala-Hume and continue to Scott Free. 

  <font color='#33FF33'>Omni</font>
  <font color='#FF9900'>Omni: Operator Xum-Nar Dal</font>
	Operator Xum-Nar Dal is found in the Unredeemed Village in Western Adonis (south of Piercing Tundra on Sheremap)

	He will give you task of killing <font color='#FF9900'>5 Den-Losas</font> and 5 El-Kaals</font>
	These are located at the northern edge of the the Redeemed village in the Outmost Yard in Eastern Adonis
	If using Sheremap, look for the location just north of Dr Pan listed there.

	Next, you need to kill <font color='#FF9900'>Car-Mea the Custodian</font>, located in a dungeon.
  To get there, just follow your directional arrow.
  ****Insider tip - Dungeon is at the <font color='#FF9900'>190 Incarnator</font>, just south of <font color='#FF9900'>City North</font> Statue exit, door is the one of the NORTH side of the incarnator****
 	Once dead, claim your reward - <img src=rdb://37932><a href='itemref://226267/226267/1'>Kanel's Story - Second Edition (Spec 3/2)</a> from Operator Xum-Nar Dal and continue to Scott Free. 

  <font color = yellow>Step 4:</font><font color='#FF9900'> Scott Free</font>
  His first task for you is to collect <font color='#33FF33'>peach, purple and green</font> recollection shards (Adonis Recollection Shards), that drop from <font color='#33FF33'>Scintillated Spirits</font> north of his location.
	For your troubles, you'll receive <img src=rdb://37932><a href='itemref://226268/226268/1'>Kanel's Story - Third Edition (Spec 3/3)</a> and a new mission
	His second task will be to find and kill <font color='#33FF33'>Amok Baraton</font>, which can be found South/Southwest of the Unredeemed Village in Western Adonis.
	Loot their remains and return to Scott Free.
	He'll reward you with <img src=rdb://37931><a href='itemref://226269/226269/1'>Kanel's Story - Fourth Edition (Spec 3/4)</a> This completes the books needed for Specialization Three
  
  
  He'll send you to talk to Dr. Koumas
  
  <font color='#33FF33'>***NOTE*** After this part of the quest, you can pause in the doing of it, as the mission to see Dr. Koumas has no timer on it.</font>
  
  <font color = yellow>Step 5:</font><font color='#FF9900'> Dr. Koumas</font>
  Located a short distance West by Northwest from Scott Free,this Jobe scientist has a problem with archeologic dig nearby.
  Dig itself is actually quite fine, there's just a small matter of pest control.
  Your task is to kill:
  <font color='#33FF33'>Ruins Guardian</font>
  <font color='#33FF33'>Ruins Defender</font> - Likes to warp you to him, even if you're not fighting but in line of sight
  <font color='#33FF33'>Ruins Protector</font> - Spawns several Adonis Soul Dredges, so a good tank or calmer might be needed.
  
  All of said mobs have some nasty tricks, like hiding if no one is near and warping to it's location.
  <font color='#33FF33'>***NOTE*** These 3 mobs are no pushovers. If doing the quest as a team, as suggested a good tank or calmer is crucial. The Defendar is level 200 and the Protector is around level 210</font>

	Once completed, return to Dr. Koumas and he'll reward you with a <img src=rdb://144705><a href='itemref://239836/239836/1'>Consanguineal Embryo of Yomi'Arallu</a>
	
	
	and sends you to see Dr.Marko Steffenson
  
  <font color = yellow>Step 6:</font><font color='#FF9900'>Dr.Marko Steffenson</font>
  He has some personal problems he needs your help with, so off we go again
  He asks you to kill 5 Sizzling Synaptids (found near Garden statues,underwater of course)
  Kill Lone Shark ( be careful here, as killing him spawns more Sharks and progressively more there after)
  Now, gather the following specimens from Blorgs:
  
  <font color='#33FF33'>Gelatinous Bell Substance, Tentacles and Rhopalium</font>
  
  Highest concentration of Blorgs is near Ergo, but of course there's really no shortage of them in the Abyss
  
  Once you've gathered these 3 items, return them to Dr.Marko Steffenson and he'll reward you with 3 Advents (all 3 are same type, the ones your profession can use for Tier 2 Glyphs).
  But he ain't done with you yet. He'll send you on search for mysterious creature.
  
  <font color='#33FF33'>Kill the Muddy Dryad</font>
  This Muddy Dryad isn't the usual stock.
  Beside being enormous, it warps attackers into water as well as spawn Tentacles that attack you.
  But nothing much you can do, since in order for Dryad Tissue sample to spawn in your inventory, you need to fight on that confined area.
  Once the creature is dead bring back Tissue sample and Dr. Marko will send you to next Yutto.
	<font color='#33FF33'>***NOTE*** After this part of the quest, you can pause in the doing of it, as the mission has no timer on it.</font>
  
  <font color = yellow>Step 7:</font><font color='#FF9900'> One Who Gives Warnings</font>
  
	One Who Gives Warnings is located at Pos: 2543.1, 981.0, 109.2, Area: The Hourglass.

	Before you can do anything with this Yutto (more accurately would be before he can do anything with you), you need to bring him his daily dose of medicine.
	So first you need to visit <font color='#33FF33'>Jackson Turnfloat</font>, located at Pos: 2284.3, 692.0, 112.3, Area: The Hourglass

	He'll give you the parts he has in stock, namely Leaves of Tonacetum Parthenium. 
	For the second ingredient - Ambergris, you need to to kill Molokh. 
	There are several around Jackson's location. Once you have both items, just combine them and return to One Who Gives Warnings. 
	He's one happy Yuttocra now, so he'll give you <img src=rdb://205500><a href='itemref://238920/238921/160'>Yutto's Modified NCU</a>. 



	He's now ready to issue his real challenge.
	With a help of Metamorphic Petrology Scanner you need to tag
	Heckler of Elements,
	Heckler of Harmony,
	Heckler of Dreams and finally Dormant Golem.
	I'm sure you will have no problems finding Hecklers, Golem on the other hand is a bit hidden.
	These can be found south and east from Jackson.

	For your troubles you'll receive 3 Wills, used for Tier 2 Glyph (Yes, all 3 are the type your profession needs).
	And you'll get the location of new Yutto to see.

  <font color = yellow>Step 8:</font><font color='#FF9900'> One Who Remembers </font>
  
  One Who Remembers is located Pos: 1602.2, 2858.1, 153.0, Area: Piercing Tundra (by Dryad dyna camps)
  
  This Yutto wants you to kill <font color='#33FF33'>4 Numb Eremites, 4 Brisk Dryads and 4 Malah-Dors.</font>
  All mobs are located around peninsula west of Yutto's location.
  Thing to remember is that on edge of peninsula dwell Hecklers, so venturing to close to Brink might not be smart idea.
  I'd warn against Dryad Dynas as well, but since they are usually camped 24/7 they shouldn't pose a problem.
  Once quest is completed, Yutto will direct you to your final contact, Mourning Calamity Five.
  
  <font color = yellow>Step 9:</font><font color='#FF9900'> Mourning Calamity Five</font>
  Mourning Calamity Five is located at Pos: 1925.5, 1107.0, 83.6, Area: The Vortex.(easy way to reach him is to run due north thru the center of Adonis City)
  He has on short task for you : to kill Tower Keeper Tagnat.
  Like with the rest of quests, if it's short, it's usually hard.
  This time you even get warning, since Yutto invites you to buff before he opens the portal to Kepeer's location.

	Keeper doesn't really hit that hard (some of previous encounters hit harder), but he has other tricks.
	Like most of said encounters, it warps. Unfortunately when he does that he breaks off attack, so his heal delta kicks in.
	He also spawns Blazing Fires on location of player who holds agro.
	Those 'pets' can't be attacked and they emit small range AoE dots.
	So best advice is to move a bit out of the range.
	Once you killed Keeper, all you need to do is to jump of that bridge and run back to Yutto.
	And for that, he'll reward you with Syndicate Brain Symbiant
