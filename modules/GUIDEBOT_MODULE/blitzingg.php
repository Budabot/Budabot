(Note: This guide was written for Fixers, but we all can learn from it. Anyone can blitz. Fixers are just better at it. :P)

Blitzing in a nutshell: Get the highest run buff you can. Cast both the long lasting and the short lasting HoT. Pull your agg/def bar to full def and run as fast as you can through the mission looking for your objective... When you find it, do what you're supposed to do (repair, find person, find item etc) and then wait for the mission complete message. If you're still alive, hit your evac and presto, you're in the grid with your reward.
As you can see, blitzing is a easy to learn, hard to master skill. Unfortunately there are no implants for it, and nowhere to put your precious IP, so you'll have to do this the way all the fixers have done it before you.
Old-school blitzers knew how to succeed because other than speed, they knew where the 'find item' was most likely to be found. It used to be near the 'back' rooms of a mission in the corner sections. However, with subsequent patches, FC has put items in harder to find locations (which sometimes equates to right out in the open).
The best way to become good at blitzing is simply, practice. Eventually you will start developing a sense to where an item will be found. Those of us that have been doing this since the beginning will concur, its a sixth sense of knowing when to stop and look around and when to keep running.
Remember the item location in the 'fireplace & stool room' when the item was located between the two hanging flaps leading towards the hidden back room? Remember the item hiding behind the false room around behind the pool of water in the 'L' shaped rooms?
It takes practice and lots of it. Even though the placement of items is more random now than it ever was, those that blitz a lot will still develop an intuition as to where the item is.
The only hard and fast rules we can give you is, get as much speed as possible, as much HoT as possible and as much evade as possible and then keep a simple pattern of running as possible (make every right turn or make every left turn, etc). Only with practice will you get good.

And here is what Seraphael wrote in the same thread:
• Clicksaver is your most valued tool, use it.
• Finding mission/item: Repair or find person type missions are the easiest as the objectives are larger and easier to discover (find person can often also be seen on map if you have sufficient map upgrade). In most cases the objectives are located in either far end corner in the mission area. Accept a good amount of blitz missions and some will be in the same zone. Fixer grid is a must.
• Mission setting: I prefer max money (you will never get xp for pure blitzes). Max open (for less locked doors/traps). If animas is your thing, pick up missions are a very easy and fast way to get the mission (you loose out on mission completion creds though, because the anima is most often the item you'll have to pick up and not the actual reward). Order is good for more ranged mobs, these can't run while hitting you as melee mobs do. Generally order mission areas are larger but more easily navigated. Experiment to find what setting gives most of the particular type of missions you want (this changes as you accept more missions though).
• Blitzing for creds: All ql200 battle suits except the desert and probably enhanced one sell for a fair amount of cash. Anima of the Abomination (ql239) is the second best direct cred blitz items and the ql212 anima is also a good bet. Save the items in a bag and get a highlevel trader to sell them for you at the trader shop for much better yield.
• Blitzing items for sale: Just ask youself what is attractive to others (this will change with every few patches and more attractive items are implemented). Some evergreens are NCUs ql130-200, ql200 recompilers, blitzable top profession weapons.

Blitz preparation:
• Buffs: Get the best run and Hot you can (generally your own should do though). Essence and reflect could help you untill you get more comfortable blitzing.
• Get your bearings: Remember what direction the exit is (if you can't find the mission objective, running out and loosing pursuit is often the best course of action).
• Double check: Turn off mob auto attack. Cast short Hot just before you run, Go full def.

Inside:
• Extra loot: Check for loot if you still haven't been aggroed, sometimes you can find some random goodies. If you run fast enough away you can often loose aggro.
• Have key, stims on the ready. If you run in the wrong direction dont hesitate to use area snare on the pursuing horde. Evac only as a last resort.
• Mission completed: Wait for the mission completion sound before evacing, otherwise the reward item will be lost. Do not evac at all if you have more missions in the same zone.

Grid Armor is a good asset, but if you know your stuff then it really isn't needed. I have blitzed ql250 missions without much difficulty naked. Which reminds me; if you do use GA then check if its still on before running

Saerra added this little note:

If you're having trouble with the 'find item' missions - start by blitzing 'find person' missions first. Some people (including me!) find those a bit easier because:
- 'people' (or mobs) are easier to see than little boxes (bigger target)
- people/mobs show up on your mini-map (assuming you have map upgrades, if you don't - get them ) - so you can watch your map and fairly easily see whether or not a room *might* have the target (i.e. empty rooms don't )
- Also, easier to see because, in general, most rooms have 1 or 2 mobs in them, if you see a room with *three* you know *one* of them must be your target
- AND, as if that weren't enough - sometimes you get lucky and the 'person' to be found will actually be a monster, in a mission full of people (or vice versa) - in which case, you see them as the only red dot in a sea of white dots (or vice versa) on your map, and can run straight for them
So, you don't get as much money/loot, but it's a good way to get some practice and get the feel of running around like crazy.
[In a similar vein, some people consider 'repair' missions easier than find item missions as well, again, because your 'target' is larger, thus harder to miss, than the little boxes ]
Another tip, if you find yourself with a huge train of mobs that you aren't losing - get them into one place, preferably a little side room that you won't have to go through again, and throw an area snare or two. You can then either run out, or grid out, and re-enter the mission. Just make sure you keep enough nano to grid out at the end
And for goodness' sake, if you do solo missions, pay attention to where you find the mission item! It will help develop your sense of where to go when you do blitz. When you're doing a solo mission, take a look at the map when you get inside, and see if you can guess where the reward will be.
And, yes, runspeed is your friend. Being able to outrun mobs when blitzing is very very nice lol.

And Kaghelion told us that:
- If your machine can handle the load, blitz in 3rd person mode to get a better view. Make sure you don't get any freeze-ups or stalls when you go through doors, that will kill you.
- Runspeed is THE most important thing. Evades, GA, SWS only helps you if you can outrun the mobs.
- Remove any reflect or damage shields! They will only make sure that you aggro 100% of the mobs.
- Any room with stairs and ledges are good spots to 'park' mobs chasing you. Using area snares also helps.
- Prepare your quickbar's so you have one just for blitzing. You might also prepare a special quickbar to use when you've been drained, doubles as a Pvp-backup-quickbar too.
- Mission Objects are most often NOT the first (series of) rooms left and right. More often the MOs can be found at the other end of the mission. The location of MOs can of course be changed without any warning in the next patch so don't be surprised if some old rule suddenly doesn't apply.

So, there is the basics. Now all you have to do is Practice! Go out there and pull easy missions, even missions with all grey mobs, and start running. And remember, as Gene13 stated: You can have all the runspeed in the world, but if you don't know where the MOB is you're just some dude running around in a cave, waiting to get lucky.
