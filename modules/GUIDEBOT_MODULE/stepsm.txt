 The Steps Of Madness

 Steps of Madness is a level 30-50 dungeon which was opened at Halloween 2001. Back then you needed a teddy bear called 'Childhood memory' which you got from an Uncle Pumpkinhead (special Halloween monster in 2001), to enter this dungeon. Nowadays you dont need an item anymore, just right-click the rolling eye at the entrance of this dungeon. The dungeon can be found in Omni Forest, not far away from Omni-1 - the capital of Omni-Tek Rubi-Ka.

Location: Omni Forest, 800 x 2800

Leave Omni-1 through the city gates and go North East at 800 x 2800 (Sunken Swamps) you will find the entrance of SoM which looks like a big eye in a rock.

Level recommendation: Team, 30-50
