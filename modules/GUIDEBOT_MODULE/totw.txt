The Temple of the Three Winds - written by Ryannyel

The Temple of Three Winds is a dungeon for players of level 60 and below. As the headquarters of a cult known "Cult of the Immortal One", you will encounter many religious type NPCs in this dungeon. Most common are the Cultists who are guarding this temple with their lives. Many items from this dungeon have descriptions, explaining the "Cult of the Immortal One". Please keep in mind that you will be warped out of the dungeon after reaching a certain level and you will not be allowed to go back in again if you are higher than level 62 (I go to ToTW at lvl61).

In the south east of Rome Green at 426 x 242 you should find several boxes and someone with the title "Windcaller" standing next to them. Talk to the person and once you get the option to give something to him, give him 1000 credits. You will get a key which you can use on the portal (Temple of Three Winds Gateway) next to the boxes, which will transport you to the Temple of 3 Winds instantly.

NOTE: to get back from ToTW you need fixer or yalm. Walking your way down from Greater Tir County 1814 x 2714 (exact location of ToTW) is almost certain death and will take a lot of time. Many players choose to level up there and then die, with no loss of exp.

Level recommendation: Team, 40 - 60

Lower level players may still go there, but there are huge amount of mobs in every room, so do it at Your own risk.

Below there are list of what You may find in ToTW, theres a lot of it. Besides good exp from mobs there, what You really need is Guardian Circuit Board (100% loot from Guardian of Tommorow), Memory Loop (from Lien the Memorystalker and Windcaller Yatila), Dark Memory (Lien the Memorystalker and Windcaller Yatila). Exarch robe (from every exarch)
