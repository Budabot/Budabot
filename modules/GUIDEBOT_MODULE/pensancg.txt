(white)Penumbra Sanctuary Garden Key Quest(window)(green)

To start this quest, speak to Garboil Roch Van. He is in the Penumbra Garden, in the middle of the maze to the north.


Part one: Calibrate stuff!
The Garboil will give you a mission, and a Calibration Tuner. The mission has coords, so it's a smooth ride. Upload the coords to the map, enter the mission and find a large machine. Use your Tuner on the machine, and wait for a mission update. Run out, and repeat the process 7 times. Usually all the missions point to the same location, and the machine is almost always in the same room, so it's a piece of cake.


Part two: Kill Redeemed leaders!
This one is a bit trickier, you have to kill twelwe redeemed leaders. Some are pretty hard to reach because of the adds (no problem after lvl 203 (202?), adds turn grey around then), so you might want to bring backup.

The leaders:
1. Hiisian Steed - Tainted
   Coords: 790x1290 (West)

2. Watcher Cama Mara-Thar - Leader
   Coords: 1045x180 (West) - SW Redeemed village, lots of adds.

3. Chimera Cranii - Marked
   (East) - Northeast of the Penumbra Fortress Statue.

4. Devoted Gil Wei-Wei
   (Adonis) - Upstairs in the redeemed temple.

5. Devoted Cama Zean-Mara
   (West) The Redeemed village in the cave to the north-west (where the corpse-sucker was, only further in). Hard to reach, tons of adds.

6. Watcher ... something
   (West) Northwest Redeemed temple, behind the stairs in the second room.

7. Len Wu
   (West) Southwest Redeemed village, tons of them there, pick one 

8. Sipius Cama Ilad-Lux
   (West) Southwest Redeemed village

9. Watcher something
   (West) Northwest Redeemed temple, on the top of the stairs.

10-12. Venerable Ecclesiast, Empath Alyssa, Redeemed Cama
   (West) Northwest Redeemed temple. Kill the Ecclesiast, give the shady guy 6 Cama Insignias. He will spawn the Empath. Kill the Empath, Redeemed Cama will spawn. Kill Cama, and you have the key.
