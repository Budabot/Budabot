<font color=#4169e1>Newcomers Alliance PvP rules</font>

Being part of an org like Newcomers Alliance provides a certain number of advantages
 (like anwsers to questions, nice teaming, aid in dungeons and twinking etc etc), but
 it brings some obligations too.
 
 These obligations (like following EULA, be nice to other players, keep channel clean etc etc) 
 have direct appliction when talking about PvP.
 
 2 things : 
 <font color=#4169e1>*</font> Reputation : when you do "bad" things (like KSing, delibarate Training, etc ) you get a bad reputation ... 
 but in that case, Newcomers Alliance <font color=#4169e1>gets</font> a bad reputation. And you dont want to give your 
 beloved org a bad rep, now, do you ? :)
 
 <font color=#4169e1>*</font> Tower fields : Orgs can get tower fileds, these fields give bonuses to org members that put towers
 in it, but not only : all NAer benefit from these towers in the form of the contracts. So loosing fields 
 because some loose cannon attacked the wrong clan org is not a good thing.

So now the DO and DONT :

* first of, PvP is not an obligation. PvP is a special part of the game and it 's quite understandable that's some like it
and some dont. If you dont want to do PvP, fine, no one will hold you any grudge :) you can stop your reading here (lucky you :) )

<font color=#4169e1> What is strictly forbidden to do</font>

 * No Ganking :
   NA is considered as a clean org, and should continue to be. So :
    * Dont hunt in 2HO to prey on people going between grid and Whompa to get free and easy kills
    * Generaly speaking : Dont force Pvp on those that dont want to... (like coming near an enfo that mongo with a flag ...)
    * Dont interefer in others duel. (Like waiting for the 2 duelers to be near death to gank them both

 * No Loose Canons :
   NA wants to keep their tower sites. So when someone attack another tower site, all our fields become attackable...
   Moreover, when someone attack a field, a worldwide message is broadcasted ... so not only the offended org, but all
   other clan orgs are aware that our fields are open => no a good idea considering the low number of pvp twinks to defend in NA
   
   So the golden rule is :Dont attack a field on your own accord 

  * Figth fair, even when defending our towers :
    I certainly won't ask you to fight selfbuffed, or to go 1 vs 1 instead of going 5 vs 1 :)
    But the rules for PvM apply here : so <font color=#4169e1>don't</font> train guards / mobs on opponents.

  * No trashtalk
     Even if you get ganked, or you loose, or you just won, dont' insult your opponent. 


<font color=#4169e1> What is welcomed to do</font>
 * Help Omni to defend !
   When you get the purple message that a field is under attack, take time to read it to check if it's clan attacking omni.
   If it is, check the level of the field and attacker to see if you have a toon in the range able to do something.
   If yes, please, go ahead !! go on the field to try to fend off the claners :)
   Just 2 remarques : If the defending org ask you to leave because they handle the attack alone, please obey
   and secondly, beware of the 6th hour : the 5% gaz : the omni towers you came to defend will aggro you if you are not in 
   team with an orgmate that own the field, <font color=#4169e1>so remember to turn off the auto attack, and put Pet on /follow !</font>.
   
   : this can be done without getting the approuval from a senior member of NA (general or prez)
   

<font color=#4169e1> What is OK to do</font>
 * Kill Gankers !
   If you happen to see gankers : camping at 2HO to kill passerby, get near mongoing enfo when flagged and stuff like that: 
   It is ok to retailliate 
   <font color=#4169e1>Warning</font> you have to ask for and recieve approuval  from a senior member of NA (general or prez)
   
 * Help Omni to attack :
   If Pvpnet or RC bot ask for reinforcement to attack a clan base, you are welcome to join in the fray <font color=#4169e1>IF YOU DONT ATTACK TOWERS</font>
   You are welcome to go there to kill the clans that come to defend. If you dont attack towers, our field dont get open, and there's no
   message broadcasted that NA attacked a field, so it is ok .
   <font color=#4169e1>Warning</font> Towers will attack you if you are in range,[color=red] so remember to turn off the auto attack (and pet on /follow)!.[/color]
   <font color=#4169e1>Warning</font> you have to ask for and recieve approuval  from a senior member of NA (general or prez)
   
<font color=#4169e1> Lastly</font>
 * Help Omni to attack (bis):
   If Pvpnet or RC bot ask for reinforcement to attack a clan base, and they need more damage dealers to kill the towers quickly
   It can be allowed to attack the towers.
   <font color=#4169e1>Warning</font> you have to ask for and recieve approuval  from a senior member of NA (general or prez) after explaining to him
   the circumstances !
