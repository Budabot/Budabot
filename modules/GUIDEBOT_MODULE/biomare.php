There are lots of strange happenings going on in The Longest Road, and it seems to center around a certain renegage Biological Materials Reseach center hidden within the innocent looking Foreman's office of an Omni-Tek mining operation. 

Both OT and Clan investigators are looking into what's been happening, and they request your help! OT seems to think that the nano-virus that infected Phillip Ross might have come from Biomare. It's up to you to get the relevant information back to the investigators. 

Warning: If you want the final reward <Collar of Amplification> you MUST start the mission with Dr. Hercules Lincoln. Apperantly you can return to him even after you have run quests for Linda Osmos and you'll get simple return item quest. 

General Info 
You can get to the Foreman's office via the Whom-Pah system. The direct route is from 2H0. How you get to 2H0 is your business. Clanners can run/fly from the Bliss Whom-Pah, and there's a fixer grid exit near the entrance to mining crater. <If you're using the fixer grid to get there, you don't need me to tell you which exit.> 


 
You can walk or run toward the biomare entrance. 
 
Easy access through Whom-Pah.


Yes, this is an OT facility. There are OT guards that occasionally wander by and shoot at a clanner that just escaped with his/her life. Plan accordingly. Best is to run back inside, because if you get flagged you could really screw things up for you team, especially with pets around. <Hopefully the problems with teammate flags will get fixed soon.> 


 
He and his friends will shoot any clanners. 

 
Time for some action! Go inside!


Omni Missions in Biomare: 
Omni Investigation Mission 

AKA 'How to keep the guards from aggroing you.' 

NPC Dr. Hercules Lincoln near the Whom-Pahs in Outpost 10-3 <Pos: 1135, 2375> gives mission to deliver a report to NPC Efficiency Expert Linda Osmos inside Biomare. 





Mission Log: 
'Omni-Tek has been able to place an informant inside the Biological Materials Research facilities. Deliver the Systems Monthly periodical to Efficiency Expert Linda Osmos and return immediately with the weekly progress report she will give you.' 

Linda Osmos is at 150x365, in a dead end room with 2-3 robots. Careful with trains here. From the reception room go right in the next room and follow it to the dead end. 

Linda's Missions 
From Linda Osmos you'll get 4 missions, but have to return to her after each one. They revolve around cleaning the scum from the sewer pips. If you don't know where the sewers are, read her dialog, she tells you. 

Disable six security cameras. <You can click the scanner on the same camera six times.> 
Kill 8 toxic floaters 
Kill 8 toxic bloaters 
Kill Tri Plumbo <Level 80 sewer end boss.> 
The reward is a blank security card and 25k xp. She will also give you a report to take back to Outpost 10-3. <Reward is 20k xp and a token.> If you don't have the 'Deliver Systems Monthly' mission running you WILL NOT get the Weekly Report to return. This will break the mission chain, and you will not be able to continue! But you still can get the security card and upgrades. To continue in the mission chain you'll have to do her missions over again to get report. Go back and talk to Dr. Hercules Lincoln. 

Now to get your security clearance: 
Linda will tell you to find the Maintence Supervisor Johnson under the bridge after the 'golf ball' teleport. When you kill him, loot, and when his corpse rots, a encoder is left behind. Use your blank card on the encoder on the ground <you can't pick it up>. The encoder stays around for about 5 minutes so your whole team can get their clearance cards. 

To upgrade the card, use a 'damaged beta' card on the alpha card to get Beta clearance. Ditto for gamma on beta and delta on gamma. Equip to HUD 1 for umolested access to Biomare. 

Each card is good for one level of Biomare. The alpha card works up until the first golf ball, beta after that, and gamma up to the final level incuding the mutants. It seems that delta clearance is a very rare drop and will prevent aggro in the last zone with T.I.M and the Director. 

Where to find damaged cards 
The first place I fould Damaged Beta cards was in the hallway after the last mutant cave, dropping from security guards/officers. Damaged Gamma cards camed from Bodyguards after the Golf Ball into the directors area. So it seems that you find them in the area after that level of clearance is useful. Which is nice because once you get through an area safely, you'll get a pass to get back through it. 

Rescue the Analyst Mission 
After returning the report to Outpost 10-3, you have the option to start a 'repair' mission. You'll get an encrypted key in your inventory. 

Mission Log: 
'In the Hangar area of the Biological Materials Research facility in The Longest Road, a data analyst is hiding, waiting for you to help her to get to the nearest emergency exit.' 

Find Theresa Cameron, and help her get to the emergency exit in the hangar. 

<Be very careful of your reflects around her. On one team, she hit a enforcer with a 50k nuke after she took reflected damage. BBQ 'trox. I think the place still smells.> 

She is in the SE corner of the hanger <Pos: 255, 35>. After you speak to her, she begins walking to the emergency exit. Now anything in the hanger will aggro you. Best to clear it before hand. When she meeps out, she leaves behind a encrypted datacube on the floor. Use your encryption key on it to get a decrypted datacube in your inventory. The datacube will stay on the floor for about 5 minutes for the whole team to finish the mission. 

Now you have a return mission to deliver the decrypted datacube to Dr. Hercules Lincoln. When you do so, you'll have the option to do another mission. 

Tissue Sample Mission 
This is really 3 missions since you hand in each piece seperately. Dr. Hercules Lincoln wants a cardiac, pulmonary, and liver sample from the mutants. If you make a quick run through the mutant caves to get your parts after walking Theresa Cameron out, you'll be time ahead here. 

Hand in the parts, and get 60k-90k xp for each part. Now you'll have the option to continue. 

Computer Hacking Mission 

Mission Log: 
'Go to the laboratory area in the Biological Materials Research facility in The Longest Road. There should be computers with stored information on the nano particles used in the testing. Use the Secure Terminal Hacking Protocols to get access to the computers. When you have been able to access the sensitive data, return to Dr. Hercules Lincoln.' 

These terminals are after the mutant caves and exam room and through yet another golf ball. Use the hacking tool on the computers in the sides of the room until you get a GREEN <Sensitive Data> paper. The purple paper <Routine Data> is just a decoy. Just keep using the hacking tool until a green paper is in your inventory, you might wind up with several purples, no big deal. Return to Dr. Hercules Lincoln with the papers, and you get the last mission. 

Kill the Director Mission 

Mission Log: 
'Go to the Biological Materials Research facility in The Longest Road. Find the lab director and kill him. This will send him to a reclaim terminal at an Omni-InternOps location where he can be questioned about his recent actions and possible connection to the viral outbreak.' 

The Director is in the usual place, and will probably be up when you get there. A lot less traffic there now. Also he spawns 2 Executive Protectors <ql80> which look like floating eyes. They hit pretty hard for radiation damage, and will respawn if killed - best to mezz them instead. Since he's not being instal-killed on spawn anymore, most likely there will be 2 bodyguards in his office too. So count on the Director plus at least 4 adds. 

Once the director is dead each team member will find a 'Director's Indentification Card' in your inventory. Return this to Dr. Hercules Lincoln and get your reward: Collar of Amplification and 125k xp. 

Bonus Missions 

Kill T.I.M. Mission 
See Lab Assistant - Evelynn Shead <Pos: 382.1, 215> 

Mission Log: 
'Lab Assistant Evelynn Shead has requested your help in shutting off the disposal device known as T.I.M.' 

Easy enough, T.I.M is level 100 now, and not that bad of a kill. He drops both scopes 100%, too. Reward is 180k xp. 

Killer Cargo Bot Mission 
After doing the security clearance mission, Linda Osmos has one more job for you. Head to the hanger and kill 3 Heavy Cargo Hauler Bots. For 3k cash/60k xp. 

Miscellaneous 
Rik-Rak is a hall mob on the way to T.I.M, when you attack, 'Lab security devices' come out of the ceiling over the one Rik-Rak is fighting. These things root/stun the player/pet they're over. With a team, someone else can be killing the security devices, to free the main tank. He drops the Assult-class tank armor 100%. 

The Blind Eyemutant on the bridge after the Chemical Vindicators dorps the Medic Tank Armor. I think this is close to 100% now. 

To get the Borealis Recall Beacon, you need a SD Power Core, which drops from any robot mob. You need to take it into the section with the Lab Director and TIM, in the West round room <closer to T.I.M> there is a Data Collector type mob, give him the core and he will power up and start opening the containment areas there. Five mortiig type mobs and two scorpid type mobs are released. The scorpid mobs dropped the Recapture Beacon, which warps you from borealis to Biomare. <It's reported that the mortiigs didnt drop anything.>
