Any special reward for completing parts of this questline will be mentioned in guide. With few exceptions, the order of quests is set as continuing line. This quest line isn't level locked.

<font color = green>Dr. Jones</font>
Read the latest copy of Jobe Scientist? Dr Jones certainly has a lot to say about his field of expertise. When you have listened to what he has to say you will probably be brimming with excitement to get started on the work he has to offer you.

To start you off nice and easily, when you ask him whether you can help, he has 2 simple quests for you.
Firstly you will need to find and observe (target) Limping Beit and regular Beit. They are located just north of where he is standing.

Target them in the specified order to fulfill this mission.

Limping Beit

At the same time as receiving the other mission, you will have received one to find and kill 3 Aggresive Beits.

When you kill each of them, three <a href='itemref://263641/263641/1'>Beit Bones</a> will spawn in your inventory. (Please note: These mobs might not be at the exact spot the map shows, since they start roaming around once spawned.)

Once you return, he wants another set of Bones, this time <a href='itemref://263642/263642/1'>Old Beit Bones</a>, which are located in The Plundge - Facility Entrance.

The mission requires you to find the item in dungeon, pick it up and bring it back.
.. not really like bones at all from first glance huh!

So, with the old bones in your inventory and your mission updated, you need to head back to Dr Jones, open dialog with him and trade him his old bones. After a chat, he will direct you to Technologist Frank Jobin.

<font color = green>Technologist Frank Jobin</font>

Frank will talk to you about the structure of the Notum Battery Tree which he is stood next to. He also wants you to obtain a <a href='itemref://229603/229603/1'>Crystal Filled by the Source</a> for him, of which the quality level of crystal doesn't appear to matter.

When you have gained one and traded it with him, he will ask you to spawn 2 crystals for him.

<a href='itemref://265665/265665/100'>Prepared Notum Crystal with Imature Voidling</a> and <a href='itemref://265666/265666/150'>Prepared Notum Crytsal with Adolescent Voiding</a>

You will need to spawn these at the Incarnotors in Scheol.  The mission has a way point of the western incarnator to start with. So, lets head there!

To spawn pocket bosses, you must target the incarnator by clicking it, and then click the crystal while it is in your inventory.

Our first spawn will be the Imature Voidling:

Once that is killed, your mission will update and show you towards the eastern incarnator.

The second pocket boss to spawn is the Adolescent Voidling:

Neither of these pocket bosses drop anything, so as soon as the second one hits the floor, you can start heading back to Frank. When you begin talking with him he will tell you about how the incarnators work, but not long into the conversation will suggest that you speak with Dr Hestiya.  He asks you to deliver an <a href='itemref://263858/263858/1'>Ancient Device</a> to her while you are there.

<font color = green>Dr.Hestiya</font>

She is located at <font color = yellow>805x605</font> within a camp of level 120 Malahs. After delivering the Ancient Device, she will identify it as an <a href='itemref://229870/229870/1'>Ancient Novictum Refiner</a>, which is used for subduing novictum in the process of making pocket boss crystals. Since she doesn't need it, she will give it back to you to keep. The item is unique, so if you already have one, you won't receive another. She needs three different Xan Nanocrystals and will give you a <a href='itemref://263888/263888/1'>Space-Time Extraction Device</a> used to extract those. You can harvest the crystals by right clicking this device on jars on the ground. One set of them is located right south of Dr. Hestiya and there's another set near the western incarnator.

You will have to extract three of the following types of crystals: <a href='itemref://263918/263918/1'>Cracked Xan Notum Crystal</a>, <a href='itemref://263899/263899/1'>Deformed Xan Notum Crystal</a>, <a href='itemref://263919/263919/1'>Pristine Xan Notum Crystal</a>, or <a href='itemref://263926/263926/1'>Empty Xan Notum Crystal</a>. Once you return to her and deliver those, she directs you to on towards Dr.Curry, an expert in linguistics.

<font color = green>Dr.Curry</font>

Dr. Curry is located at <font color = yellow>1090x1145</font>.

As we show our interest in learning about the Xan, he sends us off to gather literature. He is interested in one of these holy books: <a href='itemref://263877/263877/1'>The Word of Roch</a> or <a href='itemref://263878/263878/1'>The Word of Ocra</a>. He isn't picky which once you deliver to him. Those drop from <font color = red>Cama-Eltah (Roch)</font> and <font color = yellow>Or-Mada Taka (Ocra)</font>, located outside the temples. Since those are sided mobs, unless you are neutral, it is advisable to pick the opposing faction's guardians to kill. While you are there, also stay on the lookout for an <a href='itemref//264070/264070/1'>Ancient Insignia of Ocra</a> or <a href='itemref//264069/264069/1'>Ancient Insignia Of Roch</a>. You will need these in a later part of this line of quests.

<font color = green>Coma Eltah</font> for Roch, located near the Sloughing Girder spot in Temple Bog on the map
<font color = green>Or Mada-Taka,</font> SW of the Redeemed Temple in the Highlands

Once you return with to him with one of the books, he has another task for you. Equipped with a <a href='itemref://263886/263886/1'>Hadron Recording Device</a>, you are sent to earsdrop on specific targets from both factions. The device's description explains exactly why it appears to be 'just a lump of rock' -- ingenious, huh?
In any case, you are now the proud temporary owner of a well disguised listening device, and are going to use it on these two creatures: <font color = green>Diviner Ocra Path-Yeol</font>, who can be found at Mirador <font color = yellow>(920x1235)</font> and <font color = green>Fortuitous Dom-Nar Roch</font>, to be found in Bastion <font color = green>(1580x1755)</font>.

For both of them, you need to right click the device on them. This can be done from quite a distance, so if you are intimidated by the masses of bodyguards they have, there is no reason to get close and personal with them.

When you have made the recordings and returned the device to Dr. Curry, he suggests you pay a visit to Dr. Darnell.

<font color = green>Dr.Darnell</font>
She is sitting next to Leading Blossom at <font color = yellow>310x1110</font>. To get to her can be kind of tricky the first time around. So, we took you a picture!

If you head towards the northern edge of where it states Leading Blossom on the Sphere map, you will get to an edge. If you move your camera angle around, you will see the portal on a ledge just below you:

Don't over jump when you pop down there or else you will have quite a run on your hands back from Rubi ka!

Dr. Darnell seems to be trying to gain knowledge from studying the ways of the yuttos. Her first task for us will send you to bring back a <a href='itemref://263901/263901/1'>Spun Pygmaeus Platter</a> from The Uncharted Entrance dungeon. This is a dynamically generated mission with mobs your level, so if you brought help be sure to have a mission key duplicator with you for your companions.

Again.. really isn't what I would think a platter would look like, but on second inspection when you see it in your inventory, it sure looks good enough to eat your dinner off. Armed with your platter, return back to Dr Darnell.

After that, we tell her we're looking for a job. Her assignment is an urgent one, and requires you to collect some DNA samples. For those, you need to kill Toxic Shadows for <a href='itemref://263912/263912/1'>Tagged Shadow DNA sample</a>, Girder Runts for <a href='itemref://263902/263902/1'>Tagged Girder DNA sample</a> and Mutant Granite Spiders for <a href='itemref://263911/263911/1'>Tagged Spider DNA sample</a>.
In all 3 cases you need to loot DNA sample of the corpse, which seem to drop quite often. Finding mobs shouldn't a pose major problem, since you passed most of them on your previous quest.

Once you secure samples, you need to deliver them to Guard Ulf Reinhart at Port5 in Elysium. As a receipt for these, you will receive a <a href='itemref://263915/263915/1'>Delivery Confirmation</a> for Dr. Darnell.

So back to her we head. After receiving the confirmation, Dr. Darnell will send you on a courier job to deliver a <a href='itemref://263917/263917/1'>Jobe Research Symbolism Reference Library</a> to Dr. Hestiya.
So... back just south of the level 140 incarnator we go on our messenger duties. She in turn will give you a profession specific reward:

<font color = yellow>Searching for the Unknown</font>

Dr. Hestiya isn't done with you yet!
Now, she wants you to go to Necropolis to find proofs of Xan burial rituals. Her mission contains a waypoint that is uploadable to your planet map. At this waypoint at <font color = yellow>1255x1770,</font>, you need to kill Passive Aggressive Spirits, and return with a <a href='itemref://264066/264066/1'>Cracked Xan Burial Stone</a>. These are NODROP UNIQUE and you must loot it from their corpses.

Once you have acquired the stone, we need to head back to Dr. Hestiya.
Telling her you found what she was looking for will give you the opportunity to trade the item to her. She will however return it to you in order to take it to Dr. Darnell.
Which means, we are about to head back to the Twilight Basin.

Once you get there, advise Dr. Darnell that Dr. Hestiya asked you to bring the stone.
She will in return for it give you some information about their beliefs. This also leads us straight to her next assignment for us.

<font color = yellow>Looting the Devoted</font>

Dr. Darnell will send you to find either an <a href='itemref//264070/264070/1'>Ancient Insignia of Ocra</a> or <a href='itemref//264069/264069/1'>Ancient Insignia Of Roch</a>.
Those drop from Cama-Eltah Wens (Unredeemed) and Or-Moda Torka(Redeemed), located around Temples. Yet again, choose carefully which side of the conflict you represent and take care to avoid any friendly fire on your own side.

<font color = yellow>Learn about the Gardens</font>

When you return with one of these Ancient Insignias to Dr. Darnell, she sends you to investigate the gardens.
To help you with that, she gives you an insignia for your side's garden, since access to it is required for the third step of this mission.

First up you just have to left click garden statues of both sides.
For the order in which to do this, check the mission window. You do not appear to need the insignia even though it asks for it.
After this tagging part is complete, head into the second garden and talk to the NPC designated by the mission inside it.
We assume this is side dependant. As soon as you open dialogue, your mission will update.

Head back to Dr. Darnell.
Tell her you visited one of the gardens, and that you would like to know more about the Xan rituals.
Apparently, there were some artifacts that were maybe used in their rituals. She wants you to go to Dr. Hestiya again... How can you possibly refuse?

<font color = yellow>Ancient Rituals</font>

When you get to Dr. Hestiya, tell her Dr. Darnell sent you. She will give you the location details to find this ritual artifact: <a href='itemref://265356/263356/1'>A Scepter</a>.
Pick it up from this yet again dynamically generated mission at The Plunge, and bring it back to the doctor.
After giving it to her, she indentifies it as a <a href='itemref://265357/265357/1'>Xan Ritual Scepter</a>, and sends you off find out whether the scepter is still functioning.
For this task, you need to find some kind of altar. This mission is yet again provided with uploadable coordinates.

So, we head into the Halls of Scheol again. Once you have located it within a Malah camp, target it and right click the scepter on it. This will spawn the Great Mother, which you should kill.

After you return to report to Dr. Hestiya, she wants to make sure that the scepter is still intact.
So once you hand it over to her and receive it back, she tells you to deliver it to Dr. Darnell.
After heading there, she will reward you with a <a href='itemref//239835/239835/1'>Consanguineal Embryo of Annwn'Guinee</a>, a Tier 1 armour embryo!

<font color = yellow>Pet Hunt</font>

Your tasks are still not complete for the scientists... you would have thought by now that a complimentary garden warp might have been included... but oh no... now we have to kill some mongrels... maybe this will help them learn to understand more about the Xan.
So, Dr. Darnell will send you to kill 3 Canine Mongrels, located at <font color = yellow>875x1285</font>.
The mongrels are social -- so careful about just wading in and bashing, if you are just kinda little.
Once you acomplish your mission of butchery, <a href='itemref://265515/265515/1'>The Corpse of a Canine Mongrel</a> will spawn in your inventory.
Return with it to Dr. Darnell.

<font color = green>Ancient Urns</font>

She'll send you to find an Urn. Those are located at foot of rocky hill at <font color = yellow>955x440</font> and once you'll pick one up, it should become <a href='itemref://265352/263352/1'>Broken Xan Prayer Urn</a>.

Now you need to deliver this item to Dr.Hestiya. She'll suggest that you should find a Yutto that will know how to fix it.
That Yutto is named Vanward Four and is located at <font color = yellow>1115x1360</font>.(NW of the Roch Statue, Halls Of Shoel)

He'll indeed know how to fix it and give you <a href='itemref://226017/226017/1'>Xan Prayer Urn</a> to deliver to Dr.Darnell.
This time she won't give you any more quests, just hint that Dr.Hestiya might have some more work for you.

<font color = green>A Delivery</font>

Dr.Hestiya has a small delivery job for you. You should bring <a href='itemref://264007/264007/1'>Scan of Yuttos Wall Carvings</a> to Dr.Jones.

<font color = green>Hidden Secrets</font>

Dr.Jones is extatic about the Scan as well as Dr.Hestiya. And also about fact that his earlier theory about bones isn't correct.
Unknown to him, this is early sympthom of High Altitude sickness, coused by lower concentration of oxigen higher up.
So kids, don't go loitering afk around Scheol portal. Another sympthom is fatique, so he sends you to collect <a href='itemref://264006/264006/1'>Nucleus of Crusty Eremite</a>.

Once you bring it to him, he sends you towards Frank Jobin.

<font color = green>Thieving Spirits</font>

Frank has one last adventure for you. You should return 3 pieces of Xan technology that spirits around Ergo cave keep on stealing. And yes, those mobs are actually named Thieving spirits.

Once you have collected <a href='itemref://265361/265361/1'>Igneous Rock Machine Component</a>, <a href='itemref://265664/265664/1'>Advanced Alloy Fuse</a>, <a href='itemref://265663/265663/1'>Crystallized Notum Circuitry</a> and returned them to Frank.
He'll reward you with ql 150 <a href='itemref://238910/238911/150'>Ring of Computing</a>.
