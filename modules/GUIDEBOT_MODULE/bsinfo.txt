Guide suited for: All Classes
Faction: All
Level Range: 20-220

Lost Eden introduces the new BattleStations. Each faction has to fight to control these stations floating on top of Rubi-Ka. The winning faction will get Victory Points, which can be used to buy special items, armor and weapons. 

The goal of the BattleStation is to acquire more points than the opposing faction. A faction receives points by capturing control points. 

There are 4 such spots ; 3 are situated at the tips of the station, one is in the middle. To gain control of these control points, simply right click on it. It will take a few seconds to gain control of it, during this time, you will be unable to move or take any action. Once you control a point, points will start ticking for your side. The more points you control, the faster your points tick. 

The first one to achieve 500 points is declared the winner. The winning faction will get a set amount of VP, which is higher. The losing side will get VPs acording to the amount of points that they accumulated. 


<font color = yellow>Location : </font>

The Battlestation entryway is located at the Unicorn Platform in ICC. The entrypoint is located at the very south of the platform. 


<font color = yellow>Entering : </font>

Once you click on this platform, you will be entered in a queue. You can either sign up individually, or as a team. 

Each faction has the same amount of slots available to them. When a spot becomes available to you, a window will appear saying that there is room in the battlestation. If you signed up as a team, the invite will only come when the entire team can go in, so it may take more time. Once you get invited, clicking on the accept button will warp you inside. Neutrals will have an extra option : they will have to choose which side they will fight for. 


<font color = yellow>Buff Room : </font>

Upon entering, you will start in a special room. This room will immediatelly clear your NCU. You will also get 50000 nano every few seconds. Obviously, this room is where you will be buffing. Be quick, you only have a very limited amount of time, and when your time expires, you will be warped straight in the station. If you happen to die anywhere in the BS, you will return to this room, and start again. Your NCU will re-clear, and you will have to rebuff everything. 


<font color = yellow>Points : </font>

When inside, you will start at one of the BS's tips. You have to maneuvre your way through the BS to the different points to capture them. 

Points are calculated per tick. At every tick, the station calculates how many control points each sides have. For every control point owned, a certain amount will be added to each side's total points. The Center control point is worth twice as much as each individual side point. Meaning the center is worth 40% of the total points, so it is obviously very important to try to keep the center. 


<font color = yellow>Warps : </font>

There are various warps inside the BS. Basically, from each tip, you can warp to any of the other tips, or to the center. There will be a marking on the side of the warp, which will tell you where that particular warps leads. These are marked by letters : A, B and C. A is the NW tip, B is the South tip, and C is the NE tip. 


<font color = yellow>Exit : </font>

If at anytime you want to exit before the battle is over, there are several exit points in the middle of the station. Simply walk on top of one to be transported out of the BS. You will not recieve any VP if you use the exit. 

<font color = yellow>Loyalty</font>

Loyalty points are used by FC to insure that people don't use the BS to just farm XP.  If you leave the Battle Station before the battle is over, you will lose 2 victory points.  For every battle you complete, you will recieve one victory point.  If you get to 0 victory point, you will no longer be able to enter a Battle Station.  FC has advised there will be ways to regain battle worthiness, but how to do so has not been discovered as of yet (although picking up trash in Bore has been mentioned).
