Guide suited for: All Classes
Faction: All
Level Range: All Levels

It is time to go on the offense, and take the fight on the alien motherships. These missions will provide players with a new, and very much needed way to gain axp. Lower levels especially will rejoice as they are not level locked. There are also no restrictions on how many missions you can do, so people can grind away. 


<font color = yellow>Location : </font>
To start this mission, you'll need to go to the alien playfield. This was usually an area reserved for high level raids. These will still be present, and only high levels will be able to attend. However, low levels can now come here for the mothership missions. 

To reach the APF zone, go to ICC and head north. You will see a Unicorn Platform there. To the north of the platform is the Unicorn Landing Beacon. 

Here a ship will periodically drop, and warp people to the outfields. If the ship is not present when you get there, have patience, it will get there shortly. A blue circle will appear on the groud when it arrives. Step on that to proceed. 


<font color = yellow>Pulling: </font>
Here you will reach the Unicorn Recruiter. 

Talk to him to receive your mission. Remember, this is a team mission, and he will only give you mission if you're currently in a team. You will have 3 difficulty options. At the moment, easy and medium missions have a much lower VP item drop %. A hard mission can be however quite difficult. Keep in mind the level of your team when pulling. The ship is just west of the Unicorn Recruiter. 

Technically speaking, the mission itself is nothing special. Aside from great music and graphics, it is still a normal mission, that we will all recognize. 


<font color = yellow>The Bosses: </font>
. Here are the bosses I have found so far. With the new patch, the bosses now warp. So no more range killing. 


<font color = blue>Master of Biological Metamorphoses </font>

This one is surrounded by 2 healing towers. Killing the towers first is a good idea. When we killed them, they did not re-spawn. If you ignore the towers, they will keep healing the main boss, which will slow you down, or just plain make him impossible to kill. 


<font color = blue>Master of Time & Space </font>

This one is particular nasty. At certain points in the fight, it will spew out automated defenses. These, when aggroed, will send a small laser, targetting the groud beneath a player, which will eventually be followed by a nuke. You can see where this laser is, on the groud, this is where the nuke will land (it will take a few seconds). Once you spot it, have your team get away from that spot. If you keep doing this, the boss should be no problem. You'll just have to stay alert. 


<font color = blue>Master of PsyMod </font>

This is a funny one. His special attack is Alien Mind Warp. This will basically rendor your team unable to take any action. However, not only will you not be able to do anything, the whole team will /disco. I think, if you have to go to reclaim, might as well go out dancing. 


<font color = blue>Master of Silence </font>

The master of silence is surrounded by mobs called Nanovoids that drain the team's nano. It is of no use to kill them, as they respawn really quickly, so you'll have to make due. Some will also spawn close to the button, so having your doc stay there is useless. Keep an eye on the doc, and make sure he has nano to heal the team. This boss also has a stun, so you'll need to watch out for that also. 


<font color = blue>Master of Nanovoid </font>

As far as I can tell, this boss really ressembles the Master of Silence. He is however not surrounded by the Nanovoid globes. Instead, he himself drains the team's nano. 



The second style of boss room is the cocoon room. Here you will have a cocoon attendant that you will have to get rid of. The cocoons will also spawn adds when you attack them. The good thing about this boss room is that even when you finish off the attendant, the cocoons are still available to spawn, so you can kill them all for maximum axp. One of the cocoons will have the Cocoon Accelerator. This is the real boss, and he will drop the good loot. 


<font color = yellow>The New Aliens: </font>
In addition to our old foes, we have several new aliens to fight in these missions. Most of the new aliens still have the same classes as the old ones ie. Cha, Rimah. For more information on these classes, check out this guide 

The Dasyatis is the nuker of the bunch. Watch it if you have squishies in your team. 

Cyathus are the hard hitters. Beware these aliens, as they are quite strong, and can quickly send your tank to reclaim. 

The Oneirides are the nano casters of the bunch. This is their only method for attacking. 


<font color = yellow>The Loot: </font>
The loot in these missions will be used to gain Victory Points. There are 3 kinds of Victory Points loot. Each of them come in different QLs. Generally, the higher the ql, the higher the amount of VP. The exact number of VP gained still has some randomness to it. In many some cases, I have gotten more VPs with a lower ql item. But generally, with a ql 10 clump vs a ql 200 clump, you will get more vp for the 200.
These all look like standard Bio-Material. 

<font color = #CCAA44>Cell Templates
Awards 4 or 8 VPs 

Mitochondria Samples
Awards 4-20 VPs 

Plasmid Cultures
Awards 4-20 VPs 

Protein Mapping Data
Awards 4-40 VPs</font> 

The bosses will also drop a typed bio-material. These new typed bios will be used to upgrade the new LE equipment. Upon completing the mission, you also receive a mission token, which will help everyone upgrade their token board.
