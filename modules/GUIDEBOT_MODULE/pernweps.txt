One of the most coveted and powerful weapons by Soldiers, Fixers and Agents is a Perennium weapon. They are not hard to make and the requirements to equip one is reasonable. The lowest QL which can be produced is QL 50, up to QL 200. Their attack rate is fast, and the damage beats pretty much any Rubi-Ka weapon.

Spirit Tech Apparatus: Double Barrel
Spirit Tech Apparatus: Long Muzzle
Spirit Tech Apparatus: Short Muzzle 
QL 50 or higher 
Sheet of Perennium

The Spirit Tech Apparatus: Short Muzzle/Long Muzzle/Double Barrel items can found on Mortiig dyna bosses. Each will determine what the weapon will become. 


Spirit Tech Apparatus: Double Barrel -> Perennium Blaster 
Spirit Tech Apparatus: Long Muzzle -> Perennium Sniper 
Spirit Tech Apparatus: Short Muzzle -> Perennium Beamer


Sheet of Perennium and Perennium Bolts are common loot from Hecklers, usually found at the brink of any SL area. You can easily find a Nano-Charged Assault Rifle or Nano-Charged Rifle in Rubi-Ka missions. Hacker Tool can be purchased from general stores. 

Now lets get to the process of making the weapon: 



Spirit Tech Apparatus: Double Barrel   +   Sheet of Perennium   =   Double Perennium Barrel 
Spirit Tech Apparatus: Long Muzzle   +   Sheet of Perennium   =   Long Perennium Muzzle 
Spirit Tech Apparatus: Short Muzzle   +   Sheet of Perennium   =   Short Perennium Muzzle 


This process will require 7x Weapon Smithing and 5x Mechanical engineering skill. 

Nano-Charged Assault Rifle   +   Hacker Tool   =   Hacked Nano-Charged Assault Rifle 
Nano-Charged Rifle   +   Hacker Tool   =   Hacked Nano-Charged Rifle 

You'll need 7x Breaking and Entering skill for this step. 

Hacked Nano-Charged Assault Rifle   +   Spirit Tech Apparatus: Double Barrel   =   Half-Finished Perennium Blaster 
Hacked Nano-Charged Rifle   +   Long Perennium Muzzle   =   Half-Finished Perennium Sniper 
Hacked Nano-Charged Assault Rifle   +   Short Perennium Muzzle   =   Half-Finished Perennium Beamer 

This process will require 7x Weapon Smithing and 5x Mechanical engineering skill. 

Half-Finished Perennium Blaster   +   Perennium Bolts   =   Perennium Blaster (Solider Only)
Half-Finished Perennium Sniper   +   Perennium Bolts   =   Perennium Sniper (Agent only)
Half-Finished Perennium Beamer   +   Perennium Bolts   =   Perennium Beamer (Fixer Only
