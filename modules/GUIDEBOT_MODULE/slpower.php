<font color = yellow>Level 170+</font> (You can solo a scheol heckler)

Ok, I'll add something here to the Scheol section... but first off, you must have this, Spheremap. Without it, you are as good as lost in SL. Static Dungeons are drawn in as blue dots on the spheremap. 

I'm elaborating on Scheol becuase.... well... while everyone was out killing Elys Hecks with all the 'cool kids' (jokes, jokes), I was out and about in Scheol... maybe a little more than is healthy, but I realy love the landscape, and it is an interesting place.... only problem is you gotta sometimes contend for spawns with toons farming for pb's to get their alts into symbs, including me at the moment. But unlike some random, I'll probably help you out.... maybe....  

<font color = yellow>lvl100-120/130ish:</font> 'Enter the Mountain' 
N/NW of the portal entrance into Scheol is an Incarntor (lvl 140). This boasts a dungeon nearby with 'neutral' mobs. No Redeemed or Unredeemed here. It's a great place to farm for you Insignia of Ocra (clan insigs), for the Jobe Suit advanced pieces (chest, pads, helmet and support unit). Both insigs drop here, but at a lower rate than from sided mobs. The bonus is you can get your clan insignia without having to attack Unredeemed mobs, and ruin your faction. Another bonus is the occasional Pearl drop (great vendor food), and also, you will find Spirit Baubles, for Crepuscule Armour. Infantry can get about 1mil each, as they make nice melee weapon buff items for those that cannot afford AI armour (and realy, who can at this level without a higher alt?). I personaly used the gloves of infantry expertise for a nice 2he buff on Darkblayd. 

<font color = yellow>Chimeras </font>
I have personaly seen, but not often, soldier armour drop from these dynas (take the Marble Orchid stat from Garden). Roughly ql100-120ish iirc.... and it's nodrop, so you may want some help to get it at a level when it wil be useful to you (which realy is just keeping to the form of most SL gear). Pernicious Armour. 

<font color = yellow>Croakers</font> 
Ok, N/NE of The Temple Bog, are Croaker dynas. These drop some interesting armour along with pb patterns. The armour is Smuggler's Armour. Only useable by Traders and Enfos, it's nothign spectacular, but it gives a bonus to Comp Lit, which will help that trox enfo get some decent NCU chips in  . It is NOT nodrop, you can horde it for alts or friends, but each piece is Unique. Drops in ql's of 90-120 in this area. 

<font color = yellow>Eremites</font> 
Yet another spawn area with occasional contention from higher toons for pb's, you will find the eremites along the S/W brink area, just north of the Redeemed Temple, stretching up and away. Be very careful here, as they are close to Hecklers and Voracious Horros. One wrong step could bring a rather nasty surprise down upon you. Amongst the pb patterns they drop, they also have a chance of giving you Exploiter's Armour. This is for Fixers and Crats only... much like the Smugglers, it isn't impressive for the most part, but this also gives Comp Lit with each piece. Drops in QL's of 90-120ish, and each piece is Unique.
