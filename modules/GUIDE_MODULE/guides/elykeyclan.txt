There are 3 Redeemed Temples in Elysium. 

One in the center of the map, 1 North East, and another, slightly less obvious, South West. 

Step 1: 
First off head to the Central Temple and inside. Up some spiral stairs and take the entrance on the North. 
Speak to Ecclesiast Enel Gill and get sealed letter. 
Then show it to all of the following NPC's in order. 
The missions tells you who to see next (there is also another Enel Gil outside the Temple you can talk to). 

Chat with him, ask about the journey, and you'll get sealed letter. 
You'll get a new mission. 

The mission gives you the name of the NPC's to see next. You must follow the order that is given to you at each step.
