Head to the Redeemed Village on the East Coast.
It's the second white building area extreme NE, you have to run back across the rocks to get to it. It's an area called Acropolis.

Head inside to the first room, then run to the next.
Run up the long staircase.

In one room, you'll find Ecclesiast Gil Jha

Talk to him, get letter.

Take a letter to Gil Ilad-Ulma (same room)

Dialogue from Sipius Gil Ilad-Ulma
'Start with the wicked Jorr-Thrak Dal and Urga-Yutt Dal in the village of the enemy.
Whenever there has been mischief, they have always been involved.'

This means you need to find two unredeemed mobs:

Jorr-Thrak Dal and Urga-Yutt Dal
Located at : 1601 x 908 Adonis City

There will be 2 Portals ( left and right ) one is on each side, use portals to get to their respective areas,.

Killing these mobs, eventually it leads to them dropping a Note (not a 100% drop, so you may have to kill them a few times).

After you get it go back and talk to Ecclesiast Gil Jha, hand him the note.

Then.

'First you shold locate these Arks mentioned in the note. I have received word from the Acolyte that there are two Arks. One is standing on a platform and the other is wrecked, with parts spread all over the area. '

'.. You must find both' 'Then take the note you have brought me, and give it to the Diviner, Gil Ulma-Duna, in the Garden. He will tell you more, and tell you how you may aid the Diviners. For now, take this insignia. You may offer it at the statue of Gilthar to gain entrance to His garden...'

The Ancient Control Panel
Located at: 2802 2533 'The Platforms' (the kinda 2 massive black 'spaceship' looking things on the East Coast).

Warning: The place is populated by groups of mobs, be careful.

Second Ancient Control Panel
Located at : 1671 x 3023 Piercing Tundra on the Island next to the 3 small ones (Ice) Is the last one, it's a bit camoflaged.

After targetting both (it's a locate mission) head to Diviner Gil Yeol-Ulma in the garden, he is located in the garden at 478 x 270.

Hand him the Note, and you get the garden key!
