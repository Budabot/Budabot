<header> ::::: Redeemed Garden Quest (Clan) ::::: <end>

You should know the drill by now, so if you have to ask the quest starts after a chat with 'Devoted Cama Gil-Lux' in the Redeemed temple (North West of the zone) 

This time out he asks you to 'tag' a series of 'beings'. These are 'Target Person' missions and there are ten to locate. The quest timer is 20 days, so you'll have plenty of time...which is just as well because the mobs in Penumbra can be very nasty!

Below is a map of Penumbra with the quest locations marked and labeled. Thanks go to The Shadowlands Atlas for the Clan locations.

When you target Carlos a device will appear in your inventory called a Source Fragment Scanner. Now comes the boring part, you need to find thirty-five (yes, 35, we know its a lot...get over it...it'll be worth it) of the mob drop called 'Fragment of the Source', every seven fragments the scanner will fill and a new scanner will appear in your inventory.

Fragments can be found as loot from most mobs in Penumbra with about a 25% chance of dropping.

Once the last part is uploaded into the scanner, the key will pop into your inventory!
