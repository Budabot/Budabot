<header>::::: Guide to SL Compact Discs Quests  :::::<end>

Guide suited for: All Classes
Faction: All
Level Range: 1-50
Important note : After going through 3 ARKs and 1 GM, I can safely say some of those quests are bugged. I have experienced everything from quests not updating and completing to Unique items gone missing or renaming. Since it appears that if you stubble upon bugged quest, it will nerf additional non bugged ones, I strongly advise to do just one quest at time. Deleting bugged quests and pulling it again usually solves problems

Joshua Falker

As soon as you exit Jobe Research and cross bridge, you stumble upon Joshua Falker at 847x1100, Frontier Bridge. He has simple task for you. All you have to do is to kill 10 Swift Silvertails and 10 Barking Chimeras (You need to kill Silvertails first and only then Chimeras). Finding mobs won't be a problem, since whole of Frontier Bridge area is littered with them. While you're killing them you might find Compact Message Datadiscs.

He'll reward you with Health Coils. Upon questioning if he needs any additional help, he'll direct you towards Dr.Rosenblatt and his crew. 

Dr. Rosenblatt and his crew

You'll find them at camp located at 880x1570, Old Frontier, just a stone throw away from Spirit Temple. 

<font color = green>Dr.Rosenblatt</font> : He hands out one of most controversial quests in game. Good news is that reward for it is <a href='itemref://252157/252157/1'>Light Bar</a>, but bad news is that this quest is locked at level 90. So older, higher level characters can't get best light source ingame. To get this, he asks you to kill 5 Hiathlins and finish up with 1 Prime Hiathlin. You'll find Hiathlins in Nascence Frontier and couple of  Prime Hiathlins just before zone to Mil. Upon killing it, <a href='itemref://259955/259955/1'>Thigh of a Hiathlin Prime</a> will spawn in your inventory, which you bring back to Dr.Rosenblatt in order to complete mission. You'll also have option to ask him about Compact Message Datadiscs and what to do with them.

<font color = green>Salina Florenta</font> : She'll ask you to collect 6 <a href='itemref://259957/259957/1'>Predator Striker Blood Samples</a>. You'll find plenty of Predator Strikers (which you need to kill, so Blood Samples spawn in your inventory) a bit towards Nascence Frontier and to the left. Predators also drop Compact Message Datadiscs.

<font color = green>Libbie Hynan</font> : She'll ask you to kill 7 Weavers of Malice. You'll find them a bit towards Nascence Frontier and to the left. Weavers also drop .

<pagebreak><font color = yellow>Redeemed quests</font>

All of those quests you can pull from <font color = green>Seeker Aban Kald-Nuir</font>, located at Silence 1865x65. He also have quests involving for guide what to do with them.

His first quest involves killing 10 Spinetooth Hatchlings and then 10 Malah-Anas. There's plenty of Hatchlings in Nascece Swamps and abundance of Malah-Anas at Core. Malah-Anas also drop . Once completed, you need to bring <a href='itemref://259970/259970/1'>Population Density Sensor</a>, in order to receive <a href='itemref://227024//227025/25'>Smuggler's Armor Gloves</a> as reward.

He also gives out quests for Specialization 1 books. For that you'll need to travel to Brawl to find mobs you need to kill. (Closest Aban exit is at Nascence Wilds or Two Mountains)

<a href='itemref://226252/226252/1'>The Mariner's Father - Chapter 1</a> : Kill 5 Craig Ors and Follower Gulu-Mav Thrak (211.7x1023.3)
<a href='itemref://226253/226253/1'>The Mariner's Father - Chapter 2</a> : Kill 5 Calan Curs and Fortuitous Chi Chi Thrak (204.2x832.8 ) 
<a href='itemref://226254/226254'1>The Mariner's Father - Chapter 3</a> : Kill 5 San-Lens and Fortuitous Oma-Yutt Thrak (276.5x827.9)

In order to easier locate named mobs, I strongly suggest the use of Sphere Map.

All of those quests you can pull from <font color = green>Seeker Urga Pi Thrak</font> located at Brawl 165x1060. He also have quests involving .

Once completed, you need to bring <a href='itemref://259958/259958/1'>Infectious Disease Sample Transportation Unit</a>, in order to receive <a href='itemref://227024/227025/25'>Smuggler's Armor Gloves</a> as reward.

In order to easier locate named mobs, I strongly suggest the use of Sphere Map.
