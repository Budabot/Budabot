The Crypt aka Crypt Of Home(window)(green)

Guide suited for: All Classes
Faction: All
Level Range: 50-100

The Crypt of Home dungeon is located in Broken Shores (355, 2215) just 
northeast from the Clan City of Home. You can either use the grid to reach 
the area or use the Whom-Pah to Broken Shores from Bliss (the Longest Road 
zone). In either case, you will still need to travel to the dungeon either by 
foot or in a yalm. Storms in BS are common, so don't be suprised if you can't 
see too far ahea while traveling. 

You will find what seems to be an abandoned temple, some even say they are 
ruins. The entrance is fairly easy to find (see images below). 

The enter you need to be no higher than level 110, however there is currently 
a legit way to enter it if you are above that level. An engineer can beacon 
warp you inside, so don't be surprised if you see a high level running 
around. Players usually get their stronger characters in to acquire items for 
their lower level alts (alternative characters). 

I must warn you that this is one of the most complex dungeons in the game, 
where you need to switch levers to open doors, and even then you have a 
limited time before the doors close. Hidden mobs with good loot which you 
need to find, bosses that are well protected by their minions (or even other 
parts of themselves, you'll understand later on in this guide). 

Here is a map to help you out a bit (be aware that some sections overlap):

Note: This is the most complicated map I have made so far, I recommend that 
you be very aware of your location and which level you're in so that you 
don't get lost of confused. 

Another thing you must be aware of is that this place is very very dark, it 
would be easy for you to miss a mob which could attack you on sight. Bring 
some sort of light source if you want to see what's going on around you. Most 
images here will display how the dungeon looks like without any light source 
(except when there was zero visibility and I had to use light to show a 
location). 

Let's start with the entrance. The first challenge will be opening the door 
into the first section of the dungeon. This actually requires two or more 
players. There are doors to the left and right, each leading to two identical 
rooms which have one lever. Both levers must be switched (right-clicked) at 
the same time for the main door to open. You have 2 seconds to run through 
the door before it closes. Usually a well coordinated pair can do this, but 
sometimes it is better to get a 3rd person to stand by the door and just go 
in. 

At the other side of the door there is another lever, which will also open 
the same door. This is to allow anyone who manages to run through the door in 
time to reopen it and allow other players to enter without having to use the 
levers in the previously mentioned rooms. All mobs will except the bosses 
will be around level 70+, you will find higher level mobs near the main 
dungeon boss. Some mobs will execute a Poison DoT nano (damage over time) and 
even temporarily blind you (Followers Darkness nano). 

Mobs you will find in this section: 

Dark Cenobite drops these items: 

<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245135/245135/100'>Cloak of the Revoked</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245223/245223/100'>Dark Pistol of The Revoked</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://31837/31837/1'>Floating Torch</a></font>


The Cloak of the Revoked can be turned into Veil of the Revoked, more on that 
later on in this guide. 

Dark Summoner drops these items: 

<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245222/245222/99'>Dark Pistol QL 99 Shown for Reference</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246125/246125/100'>Collar Casero de la Cripta</a></font>


You will now find yourself in a long corridor, there will be a left and right 
corridors adjacent to the main corridor. Either path will lead downstairs 
where the first boss awaits you. Bane (level 90) will be well protected by 4 
Eclipsers next to him as well as other mobs in that small area. Something 
interesting here is that in the middle of a very small room there is a 
capsule, which cannot be opened by any means currently. Some players 
speculate that at some point this dungeon will be developed further. 

Bane

Bane drops these items: 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245276/245276/100'>Bracer of Recondite Flames</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246226/246226/100'>Human Skin Hood</a></font>


Alright, now go back to the main corridor and make your down deeper into the 
dungeon, at one point it will be so dark you will need to look at your map to 
see where the door is. 

You will enter a well lit area, where a bunch of Blorrgs with a couple of 
Eclipsers. Make your way further in and there will be a door leading into the 
Skincrawlers area and a left turn. 

Let's take a look at the Skincrawlers section where the second dungeon boss 
is located, the Alpha Skincrawler (level 90). Their hides are used to make 
Crawler Armor, for more details check this guide. The armor can also be 
upgraded to Prowler Armor with the Damaged Proliferation Unit which the 
Skincrawler boss drops, for more details check this guide. Something 
interesting is that this is the first area where you can find a Cenobite 
Shadow which is hidden from view, the only way to reveal his location is to 
search (Perception Skill applies here, 800 or higher is recommended) until 
you find him. Other ways to reveal his location is by setting a pet to /hunt 
or by using a nano which attacks within an area (AOE). 

Once you see him, feel free to end his miserable life, because he is one of 
the mobs that carries some of the best weapons in the dungeon. Any Cenobite 
Shadow you kill in the dungeon will respawn within 20-30 minutes. 

Cenobite Shadow drops these items: 

Fixer SMG Phats

<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246720/246720/100'>Blackbird QL 100 Shown (Rare Drop)</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246723/246723/104'>Blackbird QL 104</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246724/246724/105'>Blinded Blackbird QL 105</a></font> 

1HE Phats

<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246710/246710/100'>Chiroptera QL 100 (Rare Drop)</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246713/246713/104'>Chiroptera QL 104</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246714/246714/105'>Crispy Chiroptera</a></font> 

1HB Phats

<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246705/246705/100'>Howlet</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246708/246708/104'>Howlet</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246709/246709/105'>Hungry Howlet</a></font>


The Cenobite Shadow does not have a 100% drop on any of the 15 different 
weapons listed, however sometimes you get lucky and get a handful of these 
weapons. The Blackbirds are Fixer only 1h SMG weapons, Chiropteras are 1he 
weapons for Enforcers and Adventurers and the Howlets are 2hb weapons for 
Enforcers and Meta-Physicist. 

The Skincrawlers mobs like the darkness, so watch for them in the shadows. 
You will find the Alpha Skincrawler at the back of the main room relaxing on 
what appears to be an old fountain. 

Alpha Skincrawler drops these items: 

<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245215/245215/100'>Damaged Proliferation Unit</a></font>
*Used to Upgrade Crawler Armor to no drop Prowler Armor
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246223/246223/100'>Brother's Brass Knuckles</a></font>

Now let's get back to the area with the Blorrgs, and take that left turn. You 
will get to a small set of stairs that leads to a dim area. Here you will 
first see a door with a couple of torches on each side of it. The door is 
guarded by Necromancers with some Eclipsers roaming the room. For now ignore 
that door because you cannot enter it from this side of it. 
 
Necromancer

Necromancer drops these items: 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245170/245170/100'>Necromancer Cloak</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246219/246219/100'>Sacrificial Ensigns of Cerubin</a></font>

The cloak is made to use a Reanimator's Cloak, more on that a bit later on the guide. 

Past that door there are two paths you can choose. One is the entrance to a 
corridor which is flooded and has a number of Abyss Serpents; another is a 
hidden path behind a small waterfall left from the other entrance. Going past 
the waterfall will lead you to a room with Dark Summoners and Eclipsers who 
appear to be guarding a capsule that belongs to their master. 

If you try to open the capsule you will hear this: 'A whispering voice in 
your head: ...You are not Cerubin, my master. I am not allowed to answer your request....' 

Besides those facts, the room is not something you need to enter for any real 
purpose besides killing the mobs within. Now if you go back and enter the 
flooded corridor be you will find that a few choices to go once you reach an 
intersection. Going straight forward will lead you to a closed door, which 
can only be opened by using a switch which we'll get to a bit later. If you 
took the left turn at the intersection, you will reach a dead end with a few 
Abyss Serpents waiting to bite your legs. Taking the right turn at the 
intersection will lead you to the third section of the dungeon which is full 
of Kizzermoles, another Cenobite Shadow will be hidding here so search for 
him if you want some of his weapons. 
 
Kizzermole


Kizzermore drops these items: 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245323/245323/100'>Kizzermole Gumboil</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245092/245092/100'>Kizzermole Tongue</a></font>

The Kizzermole Gumboil is popular with Keepers. You may walk into an Awakened 
Pit Demon, but don't always expect him to be there because you actually need 
to use a switch to spawn him (yes, another switch) which also opens the 
closed door which you were at the end of one of the corridors (you have about 
2 minutes before it closes again). The switch can easily be found in this 
section, since there is only one other room in this cavernous area. 

The good news is that besides having your path further open to you, the 
Awakened Pit Demon drops some interesting items, including an Nano-Technician 
only hood, a Pit Demon Heart that allows you to create a Reanimator's Robe, 
for more details check this guide and Pit Demon Spit for AC stims, for more 
details check this guide. 

Awakened Pit Demon

Awakened Pit Demon drops these items: 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246217/246217/100'>Hood of Wicked Inspiration</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245169/245169/100'>Pit Demon Spit</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245171/245171/100'>Pit Demon Heart</a></font>


Now let's assume you managed to get through the door before it closed, on the 
other side (which is very dark by the way) next to the door there is a switch 
to open the door from this side, allowing you to help other players access 
this section of the dungeon. A third (and last) Cenobite Shadow lurks at the 
beggining of this area. Expect to face more Kizzermoles and Necromancers as 
you go deeper into the dark caves of the crypt. There is something which is 
interesting here, at one corner you will see a fallen and broken unredeemed 
statue (from the Shadowlands expansion). You can't use it in any way, so keep 
going until you see tall pillars, which will mark an area with an Awakened 
Pit Demon and other mobs. 

Now this room wouldn't be of much interest, until you actually step on a 
section of the floor which will trigger 4 traps to open from the ceiling 
dropping 4 Kizzermoles right in front of you (or around you if you ran 
forward). 

Past this area you will come to another section of the dungeon where a few 
Necromancers are guarding a small area. Here is where things may get tricky. 
Going left will lead you to a room which is inside the throneroom (main boss 
room), but don't worry because you will be safe from him and his minions 
here. The room is inside but at the same time separated from the main room 
because of a nice metal frame. You will notice a button on the side which is 
what you will need to use to open the door to the throneroom, remember it. 

Now go back and go down a few sets of stairs, where you will come to a door 
and a switch next to it that will open it. The tricky part is that once you 
open that door you will have Crypt Guardians (level 90) and other mobs to 
deal with if you enter the next section...and if you do, the door will close 
behind you. The best tactic is to open the door and not enter the room but 
either use a ranged weapon or a nano to lure the mobs to you and clear the 
room that way. It's easier if you have a team, since one can remain behind 
and reopen the door while the rest kill the mobs. 

 
Crypt Guardian

Crypt Guardians drop this item: 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245278/245278/100'>Bracer of the Dark Flame</a></font>

Once you have the room cleared, the next step is to go back to the room with 
the switch that opens the door to the throneroom. Once you unlocked the door 
to the throneroom it will stay that way for 2 minutes. Use the second switch 
and enter the room which was just cleared, on the left side you will see a 
big door, you can enter it now. As soon as you go in 2 Crypt Guardians will 
be there, so be ready to take them down. You will notice an identical button 
which you pushed before to open the door you just crossed, it will perform 
the same function to help you get out once you're done, or if you need to run 
away from the place. 

Going a bit down another 2 Crypt Guardians will be guarding the bridge to 
their master. Be aware that if you stand near the start of the bridge the 
main boss is likely to aggro you, and even warp you to him. 

You have reached the boss mob of the crytp, Cerubin the Rejected (level 150) 
is not a happy fellow, after all he has been rejected by everyone in his life 
(and with his looks who can blame anyone for that?). 
 
Cerubin the Rejected

The battle could be very easy if you're a high level or in team. However it 
can also be very hard because Cerubin has several different tentacles that 
will come out of the ground. Most will attack you, but there is one which 
will lead him for 1,000-1,500 in a matter of seconds. This particulat 
tentacle is called Cerubin's Tentacle of Cure, so if you see it take it down quickly. 
Other tentacles can do severe damage, the less harmfull are the Lazy Tentacles. The best tactic is go focus on him and then just eliminate the healing tentacle. 

Cerubin the Rejected (and his tentacles) drop these items: 

<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246206/246206/100'>Focus-Funneling Device</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245139/245139/100'>Spirit Tech Circlet of Cerubin </a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246222/246222/100'>Shapeshifter's Vest</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246219/246219/100'>Gamboling Master's Wear</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://245271/245271/150'>Jagged Claw</a></font> QL 150 Shown
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246833/246833/1'>Grasping Ring</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246829/246829/1'>Intimate Tentacle Things</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246831/246831/1'>Tentacle Tape</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246830/246830/1'>Tentacle Thongs</a></font>
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246832/246832/1'>Tentacle Threads</a></font> 
<font color = 69E61E><a href='itemref://246834/246834/1'>Neck Eye</a></font>


The tentacle clothing will increase your swimming, but won't provide you 
protection. I think this was a joke from the Devs. Most items are nice to 
have, but the Focus Funneling Device will be an important item to any 
tradeskiller since it will lead to the creation of Focus-Funneling Helpers 
(Shadowlands expansion required), for more details check this guide. The 
Spirit Tech Circlet of Cerubin is needed to make the Veil of the Revoked, you 
can read more details in this guide. 
Once you have taken him down, his throne will be empty but you will see a 
part of him remains, I believe he will respawn 20 minutes after he is killed. 
Use the button to reopen the throneroom door and head down the corridor, 
remember that by now all the mobs you cleared are once again there so be 
ready for them. At the end of the corridor there is a door with a button next 
to it. 
If you remember earlier in the guide there was a door you could not opened 
past the Skincrawlers section, well this is the same door (from the other 
side of the wall of course). Just use the button and see the door open for 
you, but don't think you have seen the last surprise yet. The moment you use 
the button a few Necromancers will spawn right by the door, even at the end 
there is something in your way. You can choose to kill these mobs (and the 
rest in your path) on the way out, or just run to the exit.
