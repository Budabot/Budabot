<header>::::: Tchu :::::<end>

For the process of spawning Tchu you'll need 4 Hellion Mirrors. They drop from the spirits outside Ergo in Scheol.-> the rest of the quest is in Eastern Foul Plains on Rubi-Ka1. 

kill Hellion Fanatic (1550x3900) (it's on a 3 hours spawn timer). 
This will spawn four Hellion Imps:    
a)2350x3800    
b) 1300x3560    
c) 770x3500    
d) 1890x4040

After killing each imp, 4 other mobs will spawn: 3 Hellion Imps and an Orchard Philanderer. 

When the Philanderer is dead a a Pain mob will spawn (Fussie's Pain, Fecit's Pain, Filio's Pain or Fructum's Pain). This mob is not attackable. Give each one of the Hellion Mirrors to get a Focus of Pain. 

After you have all 4 pains go to the Medusa Camp and give each Witch a Focus of Pain, each witch will only accept a certain Focus of Pain, you have to see by try and error which witch needs which Focus (they'll give you the Focus back if it's the wrong one).

When each witch has the correct pain they will transform into the sister the pain belongs to. 

Talk to Malah Filio nearby, she'll give you a talisman and will also want to see the Illegible Scribbles in some strange language. show the talisman to all 4 sisters in the order they tell you and then bring it back to Malah Filio and she'll spawn Tchu in the centre of the camp. Tchu spawns 30 of Imps around him. You can either kill them or wait 30 minutes until they despawn.
