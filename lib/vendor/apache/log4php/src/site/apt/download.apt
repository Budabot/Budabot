* Please mind the signatures

	It is important that you verify the integrity of the downloaded files using the PGP or MD5 signatures. 
	Please read {{{http://httpd.apache.org/dev/verification.html}Verifying Apache HTTP Server Releases}} for more
	information on why you should verify our releases.

	The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the {{{http://www.apache.org/dist/logging/log4php/KEYS}KEYS}}
	as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Make sure you get these files from the 
	{{{http://www.apache.org/dist/logging/log4php}main distribution directory}}, rather than from a mirror. 
	
	Then verify the signatures using GPG perform the following:

---
# gpg --import KEYS
# gpg --verify apache-log4php-2.2.1-src.tar.gz.asc
---

	This should result in a confirmation message:
	
---
gpg: Signature made Fri 27 Nov 2009 07:47:28 AM CET using DSA key ID 42196CA8
gpg: Good signature from "Christian Grobmeier (Apache Codesigning) <grobmeier@apache.org>"

	Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files.
