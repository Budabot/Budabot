<header>::::: Set Limits for Tells and Privategroup :::::<end>

The Bot supports to set limits for the privategroup and responding on tells. This means you can set for example a minimum level for the privategroup with that set no one under that lvl can join the group. Same can be done for responding on tells. This helps to secure the Bot and keeping unwanted players away from beeing able to use the Bot. Note that you need to set them both seperatly!

With the command limits you can see the current configuration and changing them easily. Also you have the option to use the commands that in the versions before.
