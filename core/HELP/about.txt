To the AO Community:

I played this game for several years and have really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately I was permanently banned from AO in Nov 2010.  The short of it is, my brother's friend bought credits from a credit spammer, and FC decided it was necessary to ban my brother's accounts, his friend's accounts, and my accounts.  After 3 months of trying to get my ban lifted for something that I didn't do or wasn't even involved in, I have given up.  This version 2.0 of Budabot will be my last gift to the AO Community.  Enjoy! :)
