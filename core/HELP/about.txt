To the AO Community:

I played this game for several years and have really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately I was permanently banned from AO in Nov 2010.  I did nothing to deserve that but FC insists that I should be banned.  After 3 months of trying to get my ban lifted, I have given up.  It is unfortunate that a game this good is managed by people that fail so hard.  This version 2.3 of Budabot will be my last gift to the AO Community.  Enjoy! :)
