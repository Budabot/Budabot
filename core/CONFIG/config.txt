<header>::::: Configuring the Bot :::::<end>

With the command config you can access the config
module of this bot. First you see a list with all
modules and commands that the bot can provide. When
you go through the list you see behind every module
a ON and OFF link. These are enabling or disabling
all commands within this module. The same links can
you see behind the different commands but also a link
to Adv. which means simple you have access to the
advanced Settings. Depending if you looking at command
groups or single commands you see 2 different windows.
When you look at the group window you see the different
commands within these group. Looking at a single command
shows you the current status of it. At this window the
command can be enabled/disabled for single channels and
also the needed min access lvl can be changed.
