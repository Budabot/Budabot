To see a list of character on the whitelist:
<highlight><tab><symbol>whitelist<end>

To add a character to the whitelist:
<highlight><tab><symbol>whitelist add 'character'<end>

To remove a character from the whitelist:
<highlight><tab><symbol>whitelist rem 'character'<end>

Note: The <highlight>whitelist<end> command lets you specify certain characters that should be able to access the bot, but would not normally be able to due to limits being set. See <a href='chatcmd:///tell <myname> help limits'><symbol>limits</a>
